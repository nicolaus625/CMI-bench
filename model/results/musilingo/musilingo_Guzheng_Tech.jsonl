The script takes in an audio file in the form of a Python string, which is then converted into a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the start time, end time, and the technique used during that time interval.\n\nThe script detects the techniques by analyzing the frequency of the notes and their duration. For instance, the Vibrato technique is characterized by a slight fluctuation in pitch, while the Pluck technique produces a short, sharp note. The script identifies the techniques by analyzing the frequency and duration of the notes, and categorizes them into different techniques.\n\nIn the first example, the script detects the Upward Portamento technique in the audio, which is characterized by a smooth transition from one note to another. The second example, on the other hand, indicates that no techniques were detected in the audio.\n\nOverall, the script provides a comprehensive analysis of the timestep occurrences of Guzheng playing techniques in an audio, making it a useful tool for music producers and researchers interested in this particular instrument.",
