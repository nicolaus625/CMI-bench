In this dataset, the lowest pitch is 9 (1 octave below A_0, 13.75Hz), and the highest pitch is 119 (B 8, 7902.13Hz).

        "response": "The given audio is the bassline of a song in the key of C minor. The root note of C minor is C, which has a MIDI pitch of 60. Using the bassline, we can determine that the other notes in the song are G, D, and A. The bassline can be represented as follows:\nC - G - D - A\nTo determine the pitch of each note, we can use the relationship between the MIDI pitch and the notes on a piano. The relationship between the MIDI pitch and the notes on a piano is as follows:\nC - 60 G - 63 D - 66 A - 69\nUsing this relationship, we can determine the MIDI pitch of each note in the bassline:\nC - 60 G - 63 D - 66 A - 69\nTherefore, the bassline of the song is represented as follows in MIDI:\n60 - 63 - 66 - 69\nThe bassline is in the key of C minor, and the root note of C minor is C.",
