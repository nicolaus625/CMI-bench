        "correct_answer": "The low quality recording features a pop folk song that consists of passionate female vocal singing over repetitive flute licks, stuttering hi hats, groovy piano chords, claps and a riser sweep. It sounds energetic and kind of addictive, thanks to those interesting melodies and a fairly repetitive female vocal.",

This song may be playing in a funny video. This is an amateur recording.",
