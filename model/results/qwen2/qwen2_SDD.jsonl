        "correct_answer": "A deep house track with a very clear build up, very well balanced and smooth kick-snare timbre. The glockenspiel samples seem to be the best option to aid for the smoothness of such a track, which helps 2 minutes to pass like it was nothing.  A very clear and effective contrastive counterpoint structure between the bass and treble registers of keyboards and then the bass drum/snare structure is what makes this song a very good representative of house music",
