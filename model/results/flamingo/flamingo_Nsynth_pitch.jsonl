Be sure to convert a musical note to its MIDI number:\nMiddle C (C4) = 60\nA440 (A4) = 69\nOne octave higher = +12 MIDI numbers\nOne octave lower = -12 MIDI numbers\n\nYour response should contain only one MIDI pitch number.\n\nExample 1, when the note is A1: 33\nExample 2, when the note is F5: 77\nExample 3, when the note is A4: 69",
