The combination of the punk rock genre with the fast-paced and energetic music creates an atmosphere that is likely to be exciting and engaging for listeners, resulting in a higher arousal level. However, the lyrics suggest a sense of isolation or loneliness, which may contribute to a lower emotional rating. Overall, the estimated score suggests that the music is likely to be enjoyable but also potentially emotionally challenging depending on individual preferences and experiences. This type of music might appeal to people who are looking for something more intense than traditional pop or rock music, but still want to feel connected to others through shared experiences and emotions.",
