Therefore, the musical key of this audio clip can be estimated as C major based on these acoustic features. As an alternative, if there were more information about the context or style of the music being played, other keys could also be considered. For example, if the music was intended to evoke a somber or melancholic mood, then a minor key such as C minor might be more appropriate. However, since the music seems upbeat and cheerful, C major seems like the most fitting choice.",
