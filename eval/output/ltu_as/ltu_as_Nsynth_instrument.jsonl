Sounds of instruments are often used to create music and can be heard in a variety of genres such as rock, pop, jazz, classical, etc. The guitar is a popular instrument that has been used for centuries and continues to be widely used today. It produces a wide range of sounds depending on how it is played, including chords, single notes, strumming patterns, and more. Guitars can also be amplified through an electric or acoustic amplifier to produce louder and more distorted sounds.",
