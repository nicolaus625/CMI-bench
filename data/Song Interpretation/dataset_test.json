It's amazing how Mr Bungle, Mr Bungle has such a dense lyrical contect, whereas California is much more \"too the point?\" maybe... I think this song is about \"the all american dream\" aswell as what justedbin talked about. He sets the scene in verse one.

Being given something and it taken away, or promises which turned out untrue seem to prevail aswell (in my ears anyway) Most verses are self-explanatory but written in a \"fun fair\" way.

Thats what i think this song is about, alot of it seems to be what he would say to her when she comes back; very bitter and mocking (\"I though you made up your mind\").

Performing art is a very vulnerable thing. You open up your personal inner world \"proudly on display.\" It's about how you can create something so meaningful and personal that perfectly expresses your emotions/thoughts/etc.. yet, the crowd/audience/fans still want more. It's like your dying on stage every night, but this is precisely what you live for. Hence, the spaces in between. The spaces in between are all the moments not onstage. Those moments can begin to be less fulfilling and empty. \"The things we couldn't kill\" refers to the content of the actual song/art, because often times it is about something hurtful from your past, sometimes things which you have overcame or moved on from, and you are re-opening the wounds of you past. Your past may be dead to you in that it may no longer bother you, but you can never escape it when you are re-creating it again and again every night.

My interpretation of the \"drowning babies\" stanza is the desire to preserve innocence. As a rule, babies represent innocence and purity, however in the song, they're crying. This stands to show that something bad in the world has upset them, they're losing their innocence. The only way to keep them from losing more and save them from further suffering in the world is to end their life, but this act would upset the mothers and thus create more loss of innocence and suffering, so he doesn't do it. In an odd way, I think his willingness to commit such an awful crime actually shows a lot of strength and self-sacrifice.

I believe that its also encouraging her to have faith. The lyrics at the end say \" whisper, lose your sight\". Those that lose their sight must see by faith, he is encouraging her to trust and have faith that everything will turn out fine. It also says \"but I can't move the mountains for you\" which seems to mean that he can't place that faith that in her.

I think this song is more of a breakup song or dealing with someone's disillusion after a breakup of a relationship. \"The sun always shines on TV\" is more a reference to how this is not a perfect world and life doesn't turn out how you always want it, leading to feelings of emptiness and disappointment. There is definitely a wish for escapism and that something is missing from life. Much like the rest of the Hunting High and Low album, there is a somber mood in spite of the synth-pop sound.

He's moving on to a solo career and they're still in the career they've been in since 2010, thus they feel they are holding on to the past. They're stuck in the image of a boyband and \"wish they could be more like\" Zayn, since he has the opportunity to recreate himself without them. In the second verse, they're wondering if he ever misses them, or if he tries to \"come to the other side\". They also wonder if he feels bad for them since they are still in the band, \"wasting away their lives\". In the bridge, they describe how even though Zayn left the band, they are constantly haunted by his presence, seeing and hearing him everywhere."}, {"music4all_id": "3UjldAbaOCZJGRao", "songmeanings_id": "11783", "lyrics": "What does friend mean to you?\n A word so wrongfully abused\n Are you like me, confused\n All included but you\n Alone...\n \n The sounds of silence often soothe\n Shapes and colors shift with mood\n Pupils widen and change their hue\n Rapid brown avoid clear blue\n \n Why's it have to be this way\n Be this way...\n Be this way...\n Be this way...\n Be this way...\n Be this way...\n \n Flowers watched through wide brown eyes\n A child sings an unclaimed tune\n Innocence spins cold cocoon\n Grow to see the pain too soon\n \n Why's it have to be this way\n Be this way...\n Be this way...\n Be this way...\n Be this way...\n Be this way...\n Be this way...\n \n \"At 7 am on a Tuesday, usual August ...\n Next week I'll be 28...\n I'm still young, it'll be me...\n Off the wall I scrape... you...\n I can't wake, I gotta wake...\n To cause this wake, I gotta wake no more...\n It causes wake, to drown this hate...\n To never really stay, never will...\n You take your plate...\n Put me through hell, live, live...\n Direct your fate...\n You say I can do it so well...\n Your expiration date...\n Your expiration date...\n Fate, date, expiration date...\n (this was the last time)\n Hate...\n And don't fuck with me again...\n My own clean slate...\n Don't fuck with me again...\n Makes your eyes dilate...\n Makes you shake...\n Irate...\"", "comment": "I think this song is about someone being sociable and popular when they're young but then distancing themselves from people as they grow older because they're done wrong so many times. \"What does friend mean to you? A word so wrongfully abused\"-Meaning when you are young and naive, you think a lot of people are your friends when they're not. And he says next that he is confused. \"Sounds of silence often soothe. Shapes and colors shift the mood\"-It becomes more appealing to be aloof because different things you notice about people change your opinion. \"Innocence spins cold coccoon. Grow to see the pain too soon\"-When you're young and innocent, you are vulnerable to coldness because you're new to things. Having lots of bad experiences will make you grow old faster because you become more vulnerable. Well, this is how I see the song. I'm sure it could be interpreted several ways.

That would appeal to the line, \"Our hearts sing less than we wanted, we wanted.\" And one person is absolutely in love with where she is, but it's turning out to hurt more being in that particular place (i.e. \"I love this place, but it's haunted without you\"). One person is ready to call it quits, but the other person is trying to get them to re-evaluate their decision to leave. Which would fit the lines, \"If you live another day in this happy little house, the fire is here to stay\". That would mean that if they can make it through this severely hard time which will determine where their relationship will ultimately stand then it is something real and will last. And the last part of the song I think is the person who is asking the person to stay is saying that they shouldn't fight it because regardless of how they feel, they won't be able to let whatever is binding them together go. yeahhitslaurennnnon March 27, 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "3jPoJECcUHUypGOi", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858714363", "lyrics": "Are you out there where the rainy days\n Begin to feel rather sad\n And the walls are closing in\n Like the darkness around me\n It's so hard to look away\n when the daylight doesn't ever stay\n Above this dull apartment view\n Oh I will surround you\n \n It's quite clear that I'm stuck here\n So I'll devise a plan\n And cut out a door\n In my new living room floor\n The porch light is so bright\n That I will quickly sneak down\n The dark metal shape\n Of the rusty fire escape\n \n I bought a one way ticket\n 'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground\n Unless I was aboard a jet plane\n And we were going down\n When I wiped the tears from my eyes\n The warm water took me by surprise\n And I woke up beside the ocean\n I realized: I must be in California\n \n Aloha my happy west coast friend\n Do you feel alive\n When the breaking waves arrive\n And rush all around you\n The beach homes and ocean side\n Are quite well know by the evening tide\n And we can sleep where we reside\n With redwoods around us\n \n The blue air is up there\n And could I bring it down\n I'd bottle it up and save it\n For a sweet summer night\n \n I bought a one way ticket\n 'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground\n Unless I was aboard a jet plane\n And we were going down\n When I wiped the tears from my eyes\n The warm water took me by surprise\n And I woke up beside the ocean\n I realized: I must be in California\n \n Am I awake or is this just a dream?\n The new year is out here\n And I will make a lovely\n List of your charms\n so I'll never feel alone in your arms\n I must be in California", "comment": "I honestly think this song is about seasonal affective disorder (SAD) I have a touch of SAD, so I think thats also why I identify with the song like this. \"Where the rainy days beginTo feel rather sadAnd the walls are closing in\"\"It's so hard to look awayWhen the daylight doesn't ever stay\"--these two chunks of lyrics are talking about the depression resulting from weather, the gloom that it brings on.

Instead, he is just having fun doing what they consider to be sinning. \"I don't wanna be friend,You'll never find a friend like me\"^ These lines seem rather literal to me.

I see life as a long, weary, and vivid dream and finally when you die you are surrounded by a feeling of overwhelming peace and the heaviness in the songs Codex and Give Up the Ghost has been shed and now there's only this airy feeling of freeness and resolve. plewtoon January 16, 2012\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "3r0Gf4F8kkSbAcsP", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107859450546", "lyrics": "You're a troublemaker\n You're a troublemaker\n \n You ain't nothing but a troublemaker girl\n \n You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down\n The way you bite your lip\n Got my head spinnin' around\n After a drink or two\n I was putty in your hands\n I don't know if I have the strength to stand\n \n Oh oh oh\n Trouble troublemaker yeah\n That's your middlename\n Oh oh oh\n I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain\n And I wanna know\n \n Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad\n Oh oh oh\n My mind keeps saying\n Run as fast as you can\n I say I'm done but then pull me back\n Oh oh oh\n I swear you're giving me a heart attack\n Troublemaker\n \n It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind\n I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes\n There must be poison in those finger tips of yours\n Cos I keep comin' back again for more\n \n Oh oh oh\n Trouble troublemaker yeah\n That's your middlename\n Oh oh oh\n I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain\n And I wanna know\n Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad\n Oh oh oh\n My mind keeps saying\n Run as fast as you can\n I say I'm done but then pull me back\n Oh oh oh\n I swear you're giving me a heart attack\n Troublemaker\n \n Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad\n Oh oh oh\n My mind keeps saying\n Run as fast as you can\n Troublemaker\n I say I'm done but then pull me back\n Oh oh oh\n I swear you're giving me a heart attack\n Troublemaker\n \n Maybe I'm insane\n Cos I keep doing the same damn thing\n Think one day we gonna change\n But you know just how to work that back\n And make me forget my name\n What the hell you do I won't remember\n I'll be gone until November\n And you'll show up again next summer\n \n Yeah yeah yeah\n Typical middle name\n Typical middle name is Prada\n Fit you like a glove girl\n I'm sick of the drama\n You're a troublemaker\n But damn girl it's like I love the trouble\n And I can't even explain why\n \n Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad\n Oh oh oh\n My mind keeps saying\n Run as fast as you can\n Troublemaker\n I say I'm done but then pull me back\n Oh oh oh\n I swear you're giving me a heart attack\n Troublemaker\n Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad\n Oh oh oh\n My mind keeps saying\n Run as fast as you can\n Troublemaker\n I say I'm done but then pull me back\n Oh oh oh\n I swear you're giving me a heart attack\n Troublemaker", "comment": "To most people, the meaning of Troublemaker is fairly obvious - see other comments. However, for me the song has a different resonance. As anyone who has heard even a snatch of the song will know, it's horrendously catchy. And I have a particular talent for getting it stuck in my head. One of my delightful friends has a corresponding talent for working the song title into casual conversation, resulting in me getting it on loop... for hours. So I think this song is about a troublemaker annoying her friend by getting a song stuck in his head."}, {"music4all_id": "3scAS8oeAyKzNM8E", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858808514", "lyrics": "It's been days now\n And you change your mind again\n It feels like years\n And I can tell how time can bend your ideas\n \n And the boys go on and on and on and on\n And the boys go on and on and on and on\n And there's gold falling from the ceiling of this world\n Falling from the heartbeat of this girl\n Falling from the things we should have learned\n Falling from the things we could have heard\n \n Well it's been days now\n And you change your mind again\n All the cracks in the walls reminds you of things we said\n And I could tell you that I won't hurt you this time\n But it's just safer to keep you in this heart of mine\n \n And the boys go on and on and on and on\n And the boys go on and on and on and on\n And there's gold falling from the ceiling of this world\n Falling from the heartbeat of this girl\n Falling from the things we could have learned\n Falling from the things we could have heard\n \n And the boys, and the boys, and the boys\n And the boys, and the boys, and the boys\n Go on and on\n \n And the boys go on and on and on and on\n And the boys go on and on and on and on\n And there's gold falling from the ceiling of this world\n Falling from the heartbeat of this girl\n (Falling from this world)\n Falling from the things we should have learned\n (Falling from this world)\n Falling from the things we could have heard\n (Falling from this world)\n \n Falling from the people that we heard\n (Falling from this world)\n Falling from the love we never earned\n (Falling from this world)\n Falling from the sky that should have burned\n (Falling from this world)\n Falling from my heart\n (Falling from this world)\n Falling from my heart\n Falling from my heart\n (Falling from this world)\n Falling from my heart\n (Falling from this world)\n \n And the boys go on and on and on and on\n (Falling from this world, falling from this world)", "comment": "The best thing about Angus & Julia Stone music is that it can be interpreted however you want, its not all black and white with one meaning.

The relationship starts off all lovey dovey and sweet (It starts so soft and sweet), but as it progresses it becomes more passionate, obsessive, and fiery (turns them into hunters). The singer cannot bear to be without her lover, and will do whatever she has to do to be them. Love has metaphorically transformed into an animal (a wolf most obviously) that is rabid for the love of her partner and will hunt for him if he ever leaves, until she has him back. Another meaning I see is in the line,\" A man who's pure of heart and says his prayers by nightMay still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright\"the meaning being that even good people who are \"pure of heart\" can become monsters if the setting is right. An excellent song coming from an excellent band.

I noticed sarcasm here. It sounds like he loves the other person extremely much, and he is full of anger, completely obliterated that the relationship is over in a total confusion, unsaid thoughts that they kept from each other for a long time \"A thousand times I've tempted fateA thousand times I've played this gameA thousand times that I have said today, today, today\" that grew up to a whole of incomprehension and misunderstanding that has lead him to do whatever he's done or said.

He said he was trying brave new things like stamp-collecting, and he (jokingly) told us to quit school and take drugs. From a Christian perspective, you'd say that Sufjan has fallen, and is risking fire and brimstone (and the song worries about this - \"article of eminent death,\" \"why do things have to be so hard\"). I'd say Sufjan's belatedly finding himself. Best wishes, Sufjan!

People aren't people when they hear the sound, because the sound is so dehumanised after being run through machines. The singer is a crook, because he can be replaced by a machine that does his job better. The theme in the second verse is about the tools taking over the role of the person who uses the tools - the scissors become the barbers, the kitchen becomes the cook. It's a statement about \"what begins at the edge of town\" - a musical movement outside the mainstream that challenges the traditionally-defined role of musicians. bittersweetmeon April 15, 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "5XpUa35gFKMIsbMG", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858855505", "lyrics": "I don't know about my dreams.\n I don't know about my dreamin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin.\n Might as well fall in.\n \n I don't know about my love.\n I don't know about my lovin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin.\n Might as well fall in.\n \n I don't know about my dreams.\n I don't know about my dreamin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin.\n Fallin.\n \n I don't know about my love.\n I don't know about my lovin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm lovin, fallin, lovin, lovin.\n Might as well love you.\n \n I don't know about my love.\n I don't know about my lovin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm turnin, turnin, turnin, turnin,\n Might as well turn in.\n \n I don't know about my dreams.\n I don't know about my dreamin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin.\n Might as well fall in.\n \n I don't know about my love.\n I don't know about my lovin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin.\n Might as well fall in.\n \n I don't know about my dreams.\n I don't know about my dreamin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin.\n Fallin.\n \n I don't know about my love.\n I don't know about my lovin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm lovin, lovin, lovin, lovin.\n Might as well love you.\n \n I don't know about my dreams.\n I don't know about my dreamin anymore.\n All that I know is\n I'm fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin.\n Might as well fall in.", "comment": "Heard this recently and it stopped made me pull the car over to side of the road it was that good! For me i think this song is about a guy who has just met this girl, perhaps having recently ended a previous relationship, so his minds a bit everywhere ( I don't know about my love, I don't know about my lovin anymore) he maybe doubts his own judgement, doesnt know what he should be feeling etc. But meets this girl, and is totally absorbed by her, and as much as he tries to figure his emotions out and be rational about it, he cant help but fall for her. (All that i know is im falling falling falling, might as well fall in)Thats just my take, i think this song is sooo amazing, so simple, so direct, i think without it being to complicated the messages and feelings you get from the songs are ones you can so easily fit to your own situations.

This could be an image of a child attempting or wishing to escape from a traumatic situation or event.

The National are from Ohio and are genuine. They have outgrown the silver screen starlets and all the facades. They want to move away, raise their children outside of the bubble and live a normal life. They mention not worrying about the weather- a big reason people stay in California (eluding to moving back East where the winters can be brutal). This isn't about literal zombies or cannibalism. Conversation 16 conveys how living in a place like LA can eat at your brains and destroy you. The singer is saying he's already jaded and evil. He doesn't want his wife or children to be that way, so they are breaking out! This is one of my favorite songs from High Violet.

Maybe she's friends with the other girl and her boyfriend. I think the boyfriend kind of wants tips on how to please the girl (or really how to dance) and the narrator doesn't want to teach him \"how to dance with her\". You know, she dislikes that they're together enough, she secretly wants them to break up, so why would she help them? Possible there is/was a bit of a thing going on between the narrator and other girl and she just thinks if she helps him it'll all be over with the girl. Like maybe the narrator keeps thinking about how bad for her the guy is and how she wishes he would just \"get a clue\" and realize what's going on between them... I actually completely understand this feeling just more from a\"You are the guy that I've been dreaming of ever since I was a little girl...\"I'm not gonna teach her how to dance with you\"perspectiveBuckbeak14on August 27, 2012\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "7l0CwxkuMdLMOpXV", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858560513", "lyrics": "Such a lonely day and it's mine\n The most loneliest day of my life\n Such a lonely day should be banned\n It's a day that I can't stand\n \n The most loneliest day of my life\n The most loneliest day of my life\n \n Such a lonely day shouldn't exist\n It's a day that I'll never miss\n Such a lonely day and it's mine\n The most loneliest day of my life\n \n And if you go\n I wanna go with you\n And if you die\n I wanna die with you\n Take your hand and walk away\n \n The most loneliest day of my life\n The most loneliest day of my life\n The most loneliest day of my life\n \n Such a lonely day and it's mine\n It's a day that I'm glad I survived", "comment": "Actually, I could be wrong here, but I think this song is parodizing a world-view. It doesn't use the same lyricism in its poetry that they usually have ... \"the most loneliest day of my life?\" They know better than that. What I hear when I listen to this is that they're mocking the emo kids who listen to \"Chop Suey\" without understanding it, and write bad poetry. The whole thing is melodramatic and has very little depth compared to \"Chop Suey\" or \"Soldier Side\" for instance. In fact, except for the excellent vocals and instruments, it bears very little resemblance to anything else System has done.

He finds himself returning to the same places he has always been. He talks about the places he has never been but then says how he stays in the valley, which could be a sign of comfort. He is on his way back to where he started, meaning he was more happy where he used to be. Wishing he was a slave to an age old trade kind of hints at stability and the promise of something always being there for him. That my somewhat happier interpretation. The sad one is that he is trying to get away and start a new life but ends up in the same old places he has always been. In the valley as in a low point in his life and whiskey rivers of course refers to drinking.

She's living in her fantasy, which is why it's called \"Dreams.\" She wants to be a part of his future, his hopes, but it will never happen because he won't let it. The whole relationship, the whole idea that it could ever work out, is all but a dream, a fantasy in her mind. Fantasies rarely pan out...and even if he's lonely, it doesn't mean he's going to want to be with her. In the end, there is redemption even though he broke her heart and will never mend it.

Even if he did that before (in One Hot Minute actually), it doesn't mean he's doing it again. Back then he would refuse to explain the meaning of the songs, claiming that he hated doing that (but since the songs were about his drug habbit, he most likely just didn't want to talk about it). Now he happily explains what a song is about, and he does it in a very convincing way. Ok that being said, I, in no way, think this song is about drugs. And yes, Anthony has written songs that deal with drug issues before, but to say he has written songs merely about drugs is somewhat shallow. He has written about his dark side, the anxiety he felt as a drug addict, and the consequences of being one, among other things. And finally, my opinion of what this song is about.

I think this song is a good example of Dylan's style. If I was trying to explain Bob Dylan to someone who had never heard of him, I'd include this song (as well as at least half a dozen others, becuase he couldn't just make it easy and stick to one style--not that I would have wanted him to). All of the people and images--the guilty undertaker, the dancing child, the cracked bells, the drunken politician-- what is all that about? They show up for a line or two, or even just half a line, and then that's it. You don't hear of them again. But in spite of their short appearances, they still somehow manage to add a lot to the song. Dylan says a lot about these characters in just a couple of words.

The themes are clear - Southern landscape, religion, trains, etc- but there is little narrative voice as to what it all means, allowing the listnener to extrapolate their own interpretations...unlike R.E.M.

His voice is just incredible and I love this song. THE MEANING: I feel this song describes a man who is being suffocated in a relationship (twisting and turning in a space thats too small). He has given the girl a lot of chances and has said enough is enough one too many times (drawing the line and watching it fall). But he is at a breaking point and realizes that they are two differenet people who want different things (the pieces just don't fit anymore). He tried really hard in the relationship but he knows its time to end it and she should walk away. Sometimes letting go is harder than hanging on. I think this song is obviously about a break-up. You can give it your all, pretend that its working out but if the pieces don't fit then it just doesn't make sense.

I had never heard of uffie before seeing the invite in my f.book in-box to this revolt. I have listened to at least 10 songs by uffie including repeats of the songs previously mentioned in this thread. I hear a resemblance in voice a small bit, but honestly how many songs are there about partying and having a crazy night, then waking up to feel like a pimp. I in fact think this song is pretty enjoyable, and play this song in a bar/club and watch all the girls start singing along and dancing. It is a hit whether you like it or not. A rip off, I don't think so. Her song just happened to make it to the radio unlike Uffie, who is way to graphic for radio. I am all for graphic music, but on free air, Uffie would never make it, you would hear 2/3 of her song with the amount of censoring you would need. Over all rip off? NO. Good catchy song?

This is what i think this song is about:It's pretty much obviously a couple although this could apply to friendships also.

But the girl doesn't so easily give back the same 100% dedication/love that the guy is willing to give. Instead, she sticks around, but says some cutting remarks from time to time which leave him feeling probably a little shot down all the time, and he wishes she would just be nice. You've gotta be cruel to be kind is the response that the girlfriend gives when asked by the boyfriend why she just can't be nice.

I think this song is deliberately ironic; the lyrics to me totally express this, in true Depeche Mode fashion. This person is in love (or infatuated) with someone who he knows is well out of reach. He's toying with himself, kidding himself. He knows it couldn't possibly work out, so he amuses and/or placates himself with these thoughts. The \"It's no good\" line brings everything back to Earth, illustrating his view of the reality, not the dream. The musical tone, at its edgier moments, illustrates his torture, as he deals with the unreachable. dawntreaderon November 24, 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "ASVzFkWn0w38dydN", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107859461110", "lyrics": "Get on your knees\n And I thought you can leave it all in your mind (in it)\n All in your mind (in it)\n Crawl in the backseat old friend\n It is really all in your mind (in it)\n All in your mind\n \n You look\n So tired of living like a kite, kite, kite, kite\n Look at all the trees in the light\n They are growing all in your mind in it)\n All in your mind (in it)\n Look at all the leaves in the fire\n they are burning all in your mind (in It)\n \n All in your mind\n You look\n So tired of living like a kite, kite, kite, kite\n \n Get on your knees\n And I thought you can leave it all in your mind (in it)\n All in your mind (in it)", "comment": "I think this song is about depression as well, unfortunately I have no way of proving it but it hits close to to home.

And the person you fell for is way out of your league so you're overall afraid of how they'll feel about you in return. \"I just want you to know who i am\" means i want you to know how i feel. The moment he/she is in, is the moment of anxiousness when you want to tell the person your lov3 for them, but you don't, in fear that the friendship will overall be lost.

And this song is very odd to me because the vast majority of it sounds like Hamlet rather than Ophelia, especially the chorus. Even the drowning imagery - Ophelia wasn't able to help him when he became overwhelmed by all he had to deal with. This line is especially interesting: \"She speaks in the third person / So she can forget that she's me.\" Then there's the lines quoted DIRECTLY FROM Hamlet himself. Erm...I started listing more lines that make me think of Hamlet and I saw that my post was getting too long! I think this song is more Hamlet through reference of Ophelia than the other way around.

She loves the world, but is misunderstood. i think it shows how she is separate from the world by the like:'calendar girl, who is lost to the world'she's 'lost' to the world because they don't understand her. i think the friend on the landing is her gaurdian or something like that. or someone who wants to get to know her, but can't.

It's easy to miss, because it's a pretty skillful interplay of symbols, but other songs on the album share this theme. In fact, one could say the entire album's theme is domestic life in the 1950s-early 1960s period (aka the COLD WAR period). I think it refers specifically to a black kid who has been \"wrung out to dry\" by racism. He convinces himself he's \"pearly white,\" and tries to convince others of the same thing. playing in \"the muck and the mire\" could refer to the diversions of an underprivileged child, which is why I think it's from the perspective of a child. And because the tendency to convince oneself one is someone else is a childish tendency.

And even though she is right by his side at this moment, he assures her that when she has passed, his love for her will remain.

The National are really good at describing heartbreak, and failed relationships perfectly. Their lyrics are always so simple, but beautiful in a melancholy way. I think this song is about how their relationship is ended, but he can't let her go. He can't get her off of his mind, but she has already moved on. I like the progression of the meaning for the lyrics, \"Lucky You\". At the begining I find them like LLridinghood said, completely sarcastic, because he means that she still has him, he won't let her go, but that's not a good thing. But at the end I find there to be more truth in the lyrics, she's lucky because she is able to move on and forget and he is envious because he's stuck thinking about her, and if anyone has ever been there before it's terrible to think of someone who you loved and hurt you every day when it seems like they just don't care. Sorry, if that doesn't make sense... it's just what I think of when I hear it. jbonanzaon January 07, 2008\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "BAJHibIWrHTrcchR", "songmeanings_id": "72", "lyrics":

she not want to loose something she doesnt have to begin with. i think this is about a senario like this one:man and woman are in a serious relationship and are perhaps married. perhaps they have a kid. perhaps the kid dies and every time the man looks at the woman he sees his kid in her eyes and freezes. this would be a tuff time for both of them and i think that it would definatly cause tension between the two. it would also cause silences which is what i think this song is about. hidenmeaning123on June 26, 2006\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "BBaha1obZecGL5TC",

you are human and that you don't quite live up to the ideals that society tells you you should. For example, society tells you \"Don't care what other people think!\" I think this song references that by saying \"My names Blurryface and I care what you think.\" Plus I think Blurryface refers to the fact that he doesn't feel like he is just one person to the world. He is different things to different people, which goes against another rule that society imposes on us which is to have integrity is to be the same to all people. I think he goes on to reminisce about life when he was younger and life was simpler. You could say \"I don't care what anyone thinks of me!\" and be unique and thrive off of that. As you get older you realize that you can't be so headstrong all the time, because we are just human after all. We care what other people think because we can't always be Superman all the time. jwcalifoon November 15, 2015\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "BGMzKOAXDP5Hx9al", "songmeanings_id": "54483", "lyrics": "(Truth is I thought it mattered\n I thought that music mattered\n But does it? bollocks!\n Not compared to our people matter)\n \n (We'll be singing\n When we're winning\n We'll be singing)\n \n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n \n (Pissing the night away\n Pissing the night away)\n \n He drinks a whiskey drink\n He drinks a vodka drink\n He drinks a lager drink\n He drinks a cider drink\n He sings the songs that remind him of the good times\n He sings the songs that remind him of the better times\n \n (Oh Danny Boy\n Danny Boy\n Danny Boy)\n \n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n \n (Pissing the night away\n Pissing the night away)\n \n He drinks a whiskey drink\n He drinks a vodka drink\n He drinks a lager drink\n He drinks a cider drink\n He sings the songs that remind him of the good times\n He sings the songs that remind him of the better times\n \n (Don't cry for me\n Next door neighbour)\n \n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n I get knocked down\n but I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n I get knocked down\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down\n \n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down (ooh)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again\n You're never gonna keep me down (ooh)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (ooh)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (ooh)\n I get knocked down, (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (ooh)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (ooh)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (ooh)\n I get knocked down (we'll be singing)\n But I get up again (pissing the night away)\n You're never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)", "comment": "Everyone has their own interpretation when it comes to music.

This is accompanied beautifully by the imagery in the verses. I especially like the juxtaposition of the object of his love in a picturesque house somewhere, just silent, not even engaging his pleas anymore and beginning to accept that it is over, and the protagonist inviting insects to build a home in his head, perhaps in a desperate attempt to not feel quite so alone. In the first verse, he is clinging to the fact that he\u2019s a \u201cgood man\u201d and that his heart is huge and weighty, and he thinks this should be enough for someone to love him, though you sense he knows somewhere deep down that it isn\u2019t, and that love doesn\u2019t work like that."}, {"music4all_id": "CNDUwm7I5Yx68nvd", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858575218", "lyrics": "You took me home, I drank too much\n Because of you my liver turned to dust\n Cold rust taste, a cruel creeping cold pain\n Do you understand what I mean?\n When you feel your soul drop to the floor\n Like a hole, like an open bleeding sore\n Then you'll have bled like I bled\n And you'll have wept as I've wept\n \n Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll\n Let's hit the bar\n Let's lose control\n One false move\n You took me home\n One false move\n You're all alone\n \n But it looks so good, and it feels so nice\n I paid the price, I'll cut you out just to hear you scream\n Get away from, get away from me\n And I can feel my heartbeat racing\n As I realize what I must do\n Get away from, get away from, get away from you\n \n I should have turned and ran like hell\n The last time I got a taste of you\n I should have turned and ran like hell\n And I'll see we're through\n I should have turned and ran like hell\n The last time I got a taste of you\n I should have turned and ran like hell\n And I'll see we're through\n And I'll see we're through\n \n You fell upon me like a plague\n Weakness sweet weakness\n But I digress\n After all this\n You're just like all the rest\n \n Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll\n Let's hit the bar\n Let's lose control\n One false move\n You took me home\n One false move\n You're all alone", "comment": "Honest to God, people.

Thats pretty much what the first verse isThe second verse is about the theif explaining to the joker (dylan) that he understands and is sympathetic, possibly because he had experianced somehting similar. He says they dont understand the value of life, but the theif and joker know better. they understand the importance of life. In the third verse, two riders (theif and joker) are approaching a castle. The castle, guarded by princes and barefooted servants, represents society. a wildcat growling shows the danger of nature outside the walls of society. \"the wind began to howl\" shows that a conflict is beginning, maybe between the joker and theif, and the rest of society, in a struggle to get people to understand the value of life.

It has a good beat and catchy lyrics. But to me, the whole idea of it is about her appreciation of how beautiful women are, and how soft and gentle we are compared to a lot of men. The fact that she talks about \"the taste of her cherry chapstick\" makes me think this because it's something that is particular and and unique about women, because most guys don't wear chapstick. And buggie92, way to be more degrading than this song by calling homosexuals \"queers and lezzies.\" Who are you to tell us that we're not thinking for ourselves by supporting homosexuality? You're the one trying to cram your beliefs down our throats by telling us it's wrong.

Seeing as a 'Labyrinth' is like a complex maze sort of thing that is easy to get lost in I think this refers to her self-obsession. Also the lines ''Nothing seems to break the walls down, break the walls, down...'' and ''We'll break the walls down!'' are referring to the fact of breaking down the 'labyrinth's' walls and escaping from loving yourself too much.

Dont you remember anything i said when i said...\" see he is saying \"dont come crawling back after i already told you not to \"leave love bleeding in my hands!\" then she cries about her life and feeling contagious and SHE then says or then she cries... \"dont leave love bleeding in my hands again\"Then he says ... \"and i wanted (to stay together) but you turned away... you dont remember (or act like you dont) But IIII do HAHAHAHA ho \"you never even tried\" (this is your fault)xfakter13on June 22, 2004\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "EQxOBtM1eKLgxZrJ", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858801744", "lyrics": "October's got those orange eyes\n But somehow I still lost sight\n When you lifted the lid off of my pumpkin head\n And kissed me goodnight\n \n She could be a thorn in my side\n We never quite broke that horse\n She slept in the cul-de-sac right\n Seven miles from my front porch\n \n Bundle up and come with me now\n Down the road where to the burned down barn\n We could make a blanket of coats\n And breathe our souls into the neighbor's front lawn\n \n But, oh god, that look in your eye\n Trouble that does not search words\n It sprung from the biblical vine and\n Awaiting to return to the dirt\n \n The stitches in your winter clothes\n Your cello bows\n We stole your hair to make them\n We're sorry for the iron shoes\n We nailed to you\n And stuck you in the rain\n And then you sprinted away\n Sprinted away to where I don't know\n God's moving in your bloodstream\n Where the cross beats aren't so slow\n \n You swept all the red from my cheeks\n I didn't hear you come back inside\n I light up the gas in the den\n And stand there in the thin winter light\n But, oh god, that curve in your spine\n A question mark, a doctor's sigh\n Was framed by the windowsill\n And you saw something I did not in that night\n You saw something I did not in that night\n \n The stitches in your winter clothes\n Your cello bows\n We stole your hair to make them\n We're sorry for the iron shoes\n We nailed to you\n And stuck you in the rain\n And then you sprinted away\n Sprinted away to where I don't know\n God's moving in your bloodstream\n Where the cross beats aren't so slow", "comment": "i absolutely love this song..and personally i think this song is about a couple who's child has run away. and it seems to be reminissing about how it all started and what led to the dissagreement. it sounds like the care a worry a parent has for a child. waiting up all night. \"gods moving in ur bloodstream where the crossbeats arent so slow\" its ur blood line running away because the blind faith in convictions that kids usually have. \"sorry for the iron shoes we nailed to you\" alot of times parents feel a burden that they didnt set their kids up for success. sometimes young parents feel they arent good enough to have a child. and kids are born into \"rain\". i dunno. . . lol im not a parent or anything but thats just what i think =]habitv7on April 05, 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "ETwuGNnkTlhp0IEs", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858508556", "lyrics": "You are my sweetest downfall\n I loved you first\n I loved you first\n Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth\n I have to go\n I have to go\n \n Your hair was long\n When we first met\n \n Samson went back to bed\n Not much hair left on his head\n He ate a slice of wonderbread\n And went right back to bed\n \n And history books forgot about us\n And the Bible didn't mention us\n And the Bible didn't mention us\n Not even once\n \n You are my sweetest downfall\n I loved you first\n I loved you first\n Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads\n But they're just old light\n They're just old light\n \n Your hair was long\n When we first met\n \n Samson came to my bed\n Told me that my hair was red\n He told me I was beautiful\n And came into my bed\n \n Oh, I cut his hair myself one night\n A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light\n And he told me that I'd done alright\n And kissed me till the morning light, the morning light\n And he kissed me till the morning light...\n \n Samson went back to bed\n Not much hair left on his head\n He ate a slice of wonderbread\n And went right back to bed\n Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down\n Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one\n And history books forgot about us\n And the Bible didn't mention us\n Not even once\n You are my sweetest downfall\n I loved you first", "comment": "For some reason, I don't think this song is very linear.

I think this song does a really good job of showing how with Delilah, when his hair is cut (Second verse), he's very disconnected - He's just lost his source of power, and he goes and eats some bread, and goes to sleep, but with this other woman, he \"Kisses her till the morning light\" - how Samson really had that deep emotional connection with this other woman.

The hair resembles the disease because cancer weakens the body and immune system (like in the bibles story, he becomes weak without his hair). Samson in her life was forgotten by the history books and not mentioned in the bible, like Regina says. To her he was very important but not so important to the rest of the world so he was not worth mentioning in those kind of important texts. \"Oh, we couldn't bring the columns downYeah, we couldn't destroy a single one\"Those lines tells me they could not fight the cancer and he did die.

He doesn't want to take the first step towards her because he thinks that's her move to take, although his finding it quite hard to keep away.

In the beginning of the song, she seems to suggest ways in which she feels like a failed lover or friend (toothless dentists, cops that kill). The song then progresses to a feeling of apathy like \"just take the pills\" but then the mood picks up again and you realize that she may be talking to herself as well (Dr. Blind). I think this song is about realizing one's own dissatisfaction with a relationship and how it is ultimately sabotaging them both. It is trying to help someone you can no longer stand, but you feel like you would feel better if they got recovered with your help. Basically, codependency.

I've heard them mention it several times in interviews. But the song isn't meant to be a downer. If Scott wanted the song to be depressing and tragic, the music would be completely different. STP did this with several songs. The lyrics aren't the point, they simply follow the music. This is a fact lost on bands today who use the melodies and rhythms to get people to listen to their whining, instead of focusing on the music. I think this song is best live. It holds up when they rock out to it and as an acoustic. Not too many songs can be both.

I've had it on repeat for about 5 days now and it gets better every time i hear it. I think it's always important to find your own meaning of a song, instead of constantly picking holes in what something's not. You don't like it, don't comment. This new sound of theirs is like a whole new dimension and i think it's important that we see this side, like with many other artists too that are so capable of being versatile. If you release all albums sounding the same you're gonna get boring. Take Muse for one. Every album has been different. And Lady Gaga. Born This Way and The Fame are like day and night. But you know what? It's working, no matter how many people hated it. I was one of those that hated it but i've now grown to love them. But anyway, it doesn't matter how many synths Coldplay use or guitars they don't, the fact of the matter is, it's music. And that's what should be important.

You can't expect ALL their music to be the same, because it would be absolutely boring. Secondly, you can't expect their lyrics to always be deep and meaningful. Sometimes it's good to have a song that doesn't need to be pulled apart, dissected and over-studied. That\u2019s not the point of music; it\u2019s meant to be listened to and enjoyed. I personally dislike Rihanna. In fact, I\u2019m not too keen on Coldplay either. But there\u2019s just something catchy about this song. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the synth sounds or the fact that their voices actually work quite well together, but I think this song is good. So I can understand why some of you may form a negative judgement of this song, but I can honestly say that you need to refrain from getting so worked up about it. It\u2019s just a song.

I think this persons own emotions are overflowing and they need an outlet where they feel safe although they dont feel safe anywhere........ I dont know if that made any sense at all. afidarlingon February 26, 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "GvNz646StcDACpwE", "songmeanings_id": "7581", "lyrics": "Kiss me goodbye pushing out before I sleep\n Can't you see I try\n Swimming the same deep water as you is hard\n 'the shallow drowned lose less than we'\n The strangest twist upon your lips 'and we shall be together...'\n 'and we shall be togheter...'\n 'kiss me goodbye bow your head and join with me'\n \n And face pushed deep reflections meet\n The strangest twist upon your lips\n And dissapear the ripples clear\n And laughing break against your feet\n And laughing break the mirror sweet\n 'so we shall be together...'\n 'kiss me goodbye' pushing out before I sleep\n \n It's lower now and slower now\n \n The strangest twist upon your lips\n But I don't see and I don't feel\n But tightly hold up silently my hands\n Before my fading eyes and in my eyes your smile\n The very last thing before I go...\n I will kiss you I will kiss you\n I will kiss you forever on nights like this\n I will kiss you I will kiss you\n And we shall be together...", "comment": "I don't really think this song is about suicide. It seems desperate to me. Suicide is a solution, sometimes a very extreme solution, and every time I hear this song it seems like there is a desperation from not being able to find a solution. My take on this song is it is about the last night you spend with somebody you love and know that when you wake up they will be gone. Because you have tried everything to keep them, but they want to leave anyway and there's nothing you can do to get them to see that you need them. The line \"Can't you see I try, swimming the same deep water as you is hard\", is his way saying that he has a hard time understanding her motivations[for leaving]. Robert Smith uses a lot of metaphors for ordinary things. That's why I don't take their songs so literally because what it seems to be on the surface is rarely what it is.

The part where he sings \"What is this place, who am I, why did we come here?\" it is a question one of his children asks him and he responds with: \"I don't know, I don't know, but I don't know we're meant to know.\" Jack knows he needs to be honest with them for their own benefit and for the sake of honesty. He wants to raise them up and make them strong, like when he sings \"tree tops they touch the ground, in the morning walk with no sound, hear no birds, hear no planes, through the mud, feel the clay, build it up, make it sing, make it strong, give it wings.\" This, I feel, describes him raising his children, making them stronger along the way and giving them \"wings\" so they can later fly on their own.

The second half of the first verse is her talking about the break up fight they're most probably gonna have (\"Say something funny, say something sweet\" is most probably meaning the point in the fight when the guy tries to get the girl to calm down by making jokes or complimenting her). The second verse is her trying to figure out the reasons her boyfriend is being more and more hostile and reclusive. And the chorus is her saying that there relationship is doomed, and i's best they end it now before it becomes much worse, such as her killing (as hinted at by the various suicidal activities mentioned in the first verse).

And they are trapped by their mistakes. they can't move forward. And they keep falling into the same traps (lasso). hence the line 'where would you go tied up to a lasso'. The only people they have to turn to is each other because they're in the same boat, so to speak. 'forever is a long long time when you've lost your way'. In my opinion, the song just simply means that when your life goes off track, how do you turn things around? where would you go?

The person he left turned into someone he used to know, he has no idea who this person is anymore, stooping so low that they won't meet with him or talk to him or anything. The person changed their number so he couldn't call them or have any sort of communication with them, and he wouldn't have thought they'd be like that.

For example; It says \"I was scared of dentist and the dark, of pretty girls and starting conversations\". To me this means that the singer is saying his fears used to be so simple compared to know. Then it says; \"all my friends are turning green\". This connects to modern society and how a lot of nessecaties cost money but not everyone can afford daily life. I think \"the riptide\" and \"dark side\" are metaphors for people who are against modern society and are true outsiders. Also these two terms make me think maybe they self harm. The song also says \"Coming down to the riptide\". This makes me think that this song could possibly be about someones life that is changing so rapidly in a bad way. xoxoliviaxoxon May 20, 2015\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "HHag8Z5edgDivdz8", "songmeanings_id": "63715", "lyrics": "Candle light and soul forever,\n A dream of you and me together,\n Say you believe it, say you believe it,\n \n Free your mind of doubt and danger,\n Be for real don't be a stranger,\n We can achieve it, we can achieve it\n \n Come a little bit closer baby, get it on, get it on,\n 'Cause tonight is the night when two become one\n I need some love like I've never needed love before\n \n (wanna make love to ya baby)\n I had a little love, now I'm back for more\n (wanna make love to ya baby)\n Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be\n Silly games that you were playing, empty\n \n Words we both were saying,\n Let's work it out boy, let's work it out boy,\n Any deal that we endeavour,\n \n Boys and girls feel good together\n Take it or leave it,\n Take it or leave it\n \n Are you as good as I remember baby, get it on, get it on,\n 'Cause tonight is the night when two become one\n I need some love like I've never needed love before\n \n (wanna make love to ya baby)\n I had a little love, now I'm back for more (wanna make love to ya baby)\n Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be\n Be a little bit wiser baby, put it on, put it on,\n 'Cause tonight is the night when two become one\n \n I need some love like I've never needed love before\n (wanna make love to ya baby)\n I had a little love, now I'm back for more (wanna make love to ya baby)\n I need some love like I've never needed love before\n (wanna make love to ya baby)\n I had a little love, now I'm back for more (wanna make love to ya baby)\n Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be\n It's the only way to be, It's the only way to be.", "comment": "I think the songs send the right messages.

I think the narrator is a typical young adult that's busy, over-worked, and reminiscent of times when there were fewer responsibilities. He's maybe finally gotten a chance to rest - and now he's thinking that maybe this is really what life is about - sleeping all day, chilling, enjoying life. But he also knows that there is more to life - he has things he wants to accomplish. He knows that it will take hard work compromise to acheive what he wants to do. I think he brings up his mother and father because he's drawing inspiration from them. They have sacrificed throughout life, but thier sacrifices have brought them satisfaction and fulfillment \"would they take it all back what they've done? no way\"I don't know - that's just my interpretation - maybe a bit skewed....this is basically a description of myself - maybe that's why I love this song so much.

I agree with JASGripen's comments about Into My Arms' first stanza transforming intervention into something bad. krburg and productofthe80s, please compare the lyrics of West Country Girl, Black Hair and Green Eyes (which are definatly about P.J.) to Into My Arms. All songs are off the same album (The Boatman's Call) and presumably written around the same time. The Boatman's Call is Nick cave's \"breakup album\" and I don't think this song is about anyone in particular, but if itwas, I doubt it would be P.J. Also, I don't understand where the comments about the lyrics being \"a little corrupt\" or about \"a corrupted man being humbled by love\" are coming from. This is simply a love song no more, no less. It is not aout either platonic love or perfection, all though the theme of perfection is present from Nick's idolisation and romanticisation of the woman as being angelic.

But they fancy someone who has an office cubical 2 cubes down from him. He really likes her and can't stop thinking about her. The only view the office building has is a grey stained window, so he spends his time trying to write love notes and trying to figure out a way to tell her that he likes her. He also fantasises being with her, and doesn't have many friends. He doesn't talk to his co-workers ('spend my time with strangers') and the character in the song sounds generally very lonely. One day the girl he has a crush on leaves and works somewhere else, leaving a 'vacant 3 by 4' office cubical. The main character gets depressed, and says how the bosses will just replace her with 'a temporary stand-in for [her] face'.

In a sense, the singer is saying, \"You think this song is about you,\" and the singer is trying to delude herself into thinking that the song is NOT about you, but it really is about you, so therein lies the irony. It's like a husband and a wife having a heated argument, and the wife says, \"You think that I care what you think? Well, I don't!\" But the emotion behind the comment proves that the person really does care and is trying to convince not just the other person but herself that she doesn't care.

About the hardships that come with growing older, and all the responsibility you have on your shoulders. The second verse is about how alone she feels even though she is roaming the streets with her friends now that he is old enough to do so. I think the last verse is about wanting the old her back, the younger her. And even though she has friends that share the same fear of growing older as she does, it doesn't stop the fact that she and all of her loved ones are growing older.

I think the meaning is pretty obvious. The guy is in love with a girl who's a lot of drama, and she plays games, but he's willing to deal with all her drama cause he's crazy about her, he loves her and he needs her. The lyrics tells the story. I love the harmonica in the background, excellent guitar, this song has a very nostalgic sound, it's awesome!! That part at the end of the song when Steven goes so high pitched you almost can't tell if is steven's voice or a high guitar note.

The arthurian resonance runs through most of it - the spirit left Camelot and had to be recovered through a great quest for the grail- which lead to a perilous chapel in the forest, the black knight, the sword in the lake. I wonder if the familiar sting of the woodcutter's swing could also related to the story of Gawain and the green knight. In the end, chivalry is not love, it is its own thing. If you love someone and never ask anything of them, you're living in an idealised world, not a real relationship.

I think he is communicating to his girl that he will never quit her, and (practically) begging her to do the same. The first two verses are about the overwhelming odds against them. The last two are how the doldrums of life are a prison to him while he can only think of her, and their problems. When one gets into this sort of funk, it may seem that the partner is indifferent, for lack of passion, hence the T.V. Page line. The closing line about the shadows is simply an acknowledgment that he will always have to be vigilant and chained to this love. I tend to think the title, and chorus holds a double meaning..Hey now, hey now --- Consoling, there there..Don't dream it's over --- don't ever think I'll be the one to let goand -Hey now, hey now --- Wake up, HELLO!!!

This song is about a failed relationship due to a lack of communication. \"I give my gun away when it's loaded\" meaning that they never talked about their problems, but just ignored the issue. \"If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it\" is saying, again, that if you dont let me know what the problem is, then how is any resolution supposed to come from it? When he's saying that he's \"cheating on you\" he's more referring to not being able to let go even though the relationship is over. He still feels like he is cheating on her because they have unresolved issues and he has never gotten over the relationship. That's usually how it goes in relationships anyway. Generally, when a relationship ends merely because of communication issues, there are always plenty of feelings left. It's the stupidest reason to end a relationship and it unfortunately happens all too often. rosaparkson September 02, 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "KIxmXxckDtlFFfcp", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858776607", "lyrics": "I've been wasting all my time\n With the devil in the details\n And I got no energy to fight\n He's a fucking pantomime\n The devil in the details\n \n He's fixing up to take a bite\n I don't see the point in trying\n I got the devil in the details\n And he's gonna teach me wrong from right\n That fucking pantomime\n The devil in the details\n Well, I'm gonna dance with him tonight\n \n All of my wrongs\n No more wicked ways\n Come back to haunt me, come what may\n He wrote the songs\n That I hoped to write someday\n Looks like the devil's here to stay\n \n Let me take you for a ride\n With the devil in the details\n We'll kiss and tremble with the light\n Everything is fine\n With the devil in the details\n We're gonna dance with him tonight\n \n All of my wrongs\n No more wicked ways\n Come back to haunt me, come what may\n He wrote the songs\n That I hoped to write someday\n Looks like the devil's here to stay\n Looks like the devil's here to stay\n Looks like the devil's here to stay\n \n All of my wrongs\n No more wicked ways\n Come back to haunt me, come what may\n He wrote the songs\n That I hoped to write someday\n Looks like the devil's here to stay\n Looks like the devil's here to stay\n Looks like the devil's here to stay\n \n I've been wasting all my time\n With the devil in the details\n I got no energy to fight", "comment": "I think this song is about breaking ties with the record label. \"devil in the details\"-meaning the contract they were under. \"all of my wrongs\"- groups with agendas (companies, institutions, gov. agencies,etc.) teach that the fault is in the self-the thought processes keeps people from retaliating. \"songs i hope to write someday\"- may be literal, as in not living by social commands; or it can be taken as freedom from censorship when making and distributing future songs. \"looks like the devil is here to stay\"- demonstrates the band's resolve with the conflict.

I think Daron is trying to say that any one persons lifetime is essentially nothing in comparison to the Larger scale of things. Our life is a nothing but a drop in a waterfall plummeting rapidly towards it's end. Before and after the fall we are one in the river, this is a metaphor for the universe. This suggests we are always spiritually apart of the universe. It can be hard to understand who we are, why we are here, where we came from and what happens after we die.

However, most people are far from perfect. Some people are strange, insane, but the important thing about this song is how we all think we are strange however we are all act the same way and are imperfect and they are rebelling the 'perfect person' which indicates the lines ' the voices in my head won't leave me alone'. The lines I think there's a 'flaw in my code' also talks about how when you're different, people think you are nothing because you aren't perfect and you're different and 'strange' but there is no such thing as a perfect person and we all go through the same shit and we're all fucking hurricanes."}, {"music4all_id": "KfCJWRrBAcPjxJNM", "songmeanings_id": "43918", "lyrics": "This one goes out to the one I love\n This one goes out to the one I've left behind\n A simple prop to occupy my time\n This one goes out to the one I love\n \n Fire\n (She's comin' down on her own, now)\n Fire\n (she's comin' down on her own)\n \n This one goes out to the one I love\n This one goes out to the one I've left behind\n A simple prop to occupy my time\n This one goes out to the one I love\n \n Fire\n (She's comin' down on her own, now)\n Fire\n (She's comin' down on her own)\n \n This one goes out to the one I love\n This one goes out to the one I've left behind\n Another prop has occupied my time\n This one goes out to the one I love\n \n Fire\n (She's comin' down on her own, now)\n Fire\n (She's comin' down on her own)\n Fire\n (She's comin' down on her own, now)\n Fire\n (She's comin' down on her own)", "comment": "I personally think that this song is about a confused guy. A guy who was dating a girl and then broke up with her for one reason or another. But once he had, he didn't know why. This guy keeps on chasing the girl once he sees his mistake, then once they are together again or she seems to forgive him, he doesn't see why he should be with her anymore. Then again when they arn't together, he dosn't understand why he left her again. So the circle goes on. I think this song isn't so much about that guy, but is the guy singing. Giving the sway from being in love, to leaving her. But no matter which it is, he sees he is doing her no good. Basically he knows he is using her as 'a simple prop to occupy my time'. Then. She doesn't want him anymore. And he realises he loves her so much, he will leave her alone.

I think this song is clearly about the singer having to go away, reluctantly as he's leaving his love, but he WILL be back. He has other engagements that he needs to forfill \"I'll be chasing a stralight till the end of my life, I don't know if its worth it anymore\". He's telling her how he wants to forget the world and just \"hold her in his arms\" and could not care less what anyone else thinks because he's \"far away from the memories of the people who care if he lives or dies\", but then again, he wants the world to feel the euphoric feelings he is \"lets conspire to ignite all the souls that would die just to feel alive\".

I really feel that the \"olive branch and a dove\" is being carried by a soldier back from the war, and is an offering of peace and a rebuttal to the continuing violence in the Middle East. Overall, I think this song is illustrating the separation between the male and female halves of our country's consciousness, and that we've emphasized war over peace and compassion, and misused our religion to justify the war. Hence the wedding band and the bible hidden on the tv stand. kareyn01on September 12, 2007\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "LFwqZSmSoaIO6G4b", "songmeanings_id": "36469", "lyrics": "Two-headed boy\n All floating in glass\n The sun it has passed, now it's blacker than black\n I can hear as you tap on your jar\n \n I am listening to hear where you are\n I am listening to hear where you are\n \n Two-headed boy\n Put on Sunday shoes\n And dance 'round the room to accordion keys\n With the needle that sings in your heart\n \n Catching signals that sound in the dark\n Catching signals that sound in the dark\n \n We will take off our clothes\n And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine\n And when all is breaking everything that you could keep inside\n Now your eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their climb\n \n Two-headed boy\n With pulleys and weights\n Creating a radio play just for two\n In the parlor with a moon across her face\n \n And through the music he sweetly displays\n Silver speakers that sparkle all day\n Made for his lover who's floating\n And choking with her hands across her face\n \n And in the dark we will take off our clothes\n And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine\n And when all is breaking everything that you could keep inside\n Now your eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their climb\n \n Two-headed boy\n There's no reason to grieve\n The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves\n Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow\n And I will take you and leave you alone\n Watching spirals of white softly flow\n Over your eyelids and all you did\n Will wait until the point when you let go", "comment": "I think this song is actually about the holocaust. Here's some of the reasons why, although they are incredibly morbid and depressing...\"And in the dark we will take off our clothes, and they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine.\" When the Nazis were selecting which Jews they were going to gas, they would have them take off their clothes and line up. The skinniest and sickliest would be taken, while the ones that were still strong enough to work would be kept around for a while longer. \"And when all is breaking, everything that you could keep aside. Now your eyes ain\u2019t moving now, they just lay there in their climb.\" When you're being gassed you try climbing to the top over the weaker people to get to the fresh air near the top of the chamber.

He loves us and has done what it takes on His part to be with us for eternity, but we, too, need to want to be with Him and do our part. joshuabybeeon December 04, 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link2 Replies "}, {"music4all_id": "LY3kM9IzHsWuXE10", "songmeanings_id": "38221", "lyrics": "Do you worry that you're not liked\n How long till you break?\n You're happy 'cause you smile\n But how much can you fake?\n An ordinary boy, an ordinary name\n But ordinary's just not good enough today\n \n Now ah-ooo\n Now ah-ooo\n Alone, alone, alone, alone\n Alone, alone, alone, alone\n \n I'm thinking why, yea, Superman's dead?\n Ai yea, is it in my head?\n Ai yea, we'll just laugh instead\n I worry about the weather\n Whether you can or can not hate\n \n Now you worried about your faith\n Kneel down and obey\n You're happy you're in love\n You need someone to hate\n An ordinary girl, an ordinary waist\n But ordinary's just not good enough today\n \n Alone, alone, alone, alone\n Alone, alone, alone, alone\n \n I'm thinking why, yea, Superman's dead?\n Ai yea, is it in my head?\n Ai yea, we'll just laugh instead\n I worry about the weather\n Whether you can or can not hate\n \n Now ah-ooo\n Now ah-ooo\n Now ah-ooo\n \n Why, ai yea, hey hey?\n Why?\n Why, ai yea, hey hey?\n Why?\n \n Doesn't anybody ever know?\n Doesn't anybody ever know?\n Doesn't anybody ever know?\n That the world's a subway, subway\n \n Doesn't anybody ever know?\n Doesn't anybody ever know?\n Doesn't anybody ever know?\n That the world's a subway, subway\n That the world's a subway, subway\n \n Doesn't any, any, any, any, any\n Doesn't any, any, any, any, any\n Doesn't any, any, any, any, any\n That the world's a subway, subway\n That the world's a subway, subway", "comment": "i think this song is basically what everyone else has said, but i think the thing about \"an ordinary girl and ordinary waist\" is the main key to the song.

I also think it's not really just about use cocaine considering, as mackka pointed out, Nick Cave doesn't really write songs that are just about how much drugs suck. I think that the biblical referencing with the names relates to a loss of faith due to the drug use, and the isolation mackka pointed out is literal isolation due to friends dying, paranoia from the drug, and spiritual isolation from losing God. The loss of faith motif is continued when the cry for help, \"oh my Lord\", changes to \"save yourself! help yourself! \", meaning that God cannot help you until you help yourself, ie kick the drugs. Which is really over-analyzing things I think, because really this is just what happens when Nick Cave, a complex writer fascinated by religion, writes a song about how much drug use sucks.

Draging his feet along the floor possibly in regret of what he's done. Then he sees her walking 'cross the campus, the \"cruel professor studying romances\", i think, is the girl overthinking the situation and wondering if there was more to it than a one night stand etc... The chrorus isnt \"how am i supposed to pretend i never want to see you again [as he likes her]\" its \"How am i supposed to pretend [theres more to it than just a one night stand when really], I never want to see you again\" The comma makes it a whole different thing he's saying/thinking. Ending with shes on the stone and grass (i.e. campus) maybe waiting to bump into him again whereas he's \"sleeping on the balcony after class\" simply catching up from a lack of sleep last night - another indication of the one night stand - not thinking about her anymore.

A rich man who thinks that he knows what the real world is like and that he can survive outside of his bubble. In reality, however, he does not stand a chance in the real world. Achilles could also be correct. I do however disagree with myownprisons post about the fat boy stereotype. I think the fat boy comments are not made with the assumption stated ('I was going to say that calling him a \"fat boy\" is a stereotype but as I think about it, I guess if you were rich, you would have more to eat. It's still a stereotype, but more like a \"semi-stereotype\"') however, as another word for capitalist pig. Pig = Fat. This is all my opinion, I could very well be wrong.

I agree with JASGripen's comments about Into My Arms' first stanza transforming intervention into something bad. krburg and productofthe80s, please compare the lyrics of West Country Girl, Black Hair and Green Eyes (which are definatly about P.J.) to Into My Arms. All songs are off the same album (The Boatman's Call) and presumably written around the same time. The Boatman's Call is Nick cave's \"breakup album\" and I don't think this song is about anyone in particular, but if itwas, I doubt it would be P.J. Also, I don't understand where the comments about the lyrics being \"a little corrupt\" or about \"a corrupted man being humbled by love\" are coming from. This is simply a love song no more, no less. It is not aout either platonic love or perfection, all though the theme of perfection is present from Nick's idolisation and romanticisation of the woman as being angelic.

I think it's the opposite. She doesn't want to sound desperate or pathetic so she claims to be happy alone, not lonely at all, when in reality all she wants is to be with him. She has her guard up as she's been hurt before. He sees through this and calls her silly for pretending to be more calloused than she is. I think this song is about the union between two people who have been hurt and are cautious entering into anything. Perhaps they are casually seeing each other and both want it to be more but are worried that the other one isn't interested so they put up a front. As far as saying \"So if you're crazy, I don't care you amaze me\" I don't think he is saying that she is crazy. She's so amazing that even if she WAS crazy, he wouldn't care. That's my interpretation of it. It has a lot to do with personal experiences though.

The chorus explains how you just need to let go of everything, and how you might \"fight this all you want\" because lets face it, letting go is hard and terrifying, but is also the only way to cure the issues. \"Well if you amputate the loneliness, let anesthesia dim the lights\" I really love this line.

You can't just stop living and start working and worrying, hoping that one day you'll get that thing you wanted (thus, \"but surely something has got to got to got to give/cause i can't keep waiting to live\")So, love something, and get it.

Yet she meets this amazing guy, and is quickly falling in love again, but doesn't want him to 'catch her' cos if she fully commits then there's more chance she'll get hurt again. Yet she is totally falling for the new guy and has buterflies yet her head is telling her that it won't work and they'll end up finishing ' every hello comes with a goodbye' but she keeps going back to the fact she's totally falling head over heels for him. Eventually at the end she goes for it warning the guy ' please don't break me', takes the chance and lets herself fall for him, which is why it finally ends with 'so just catch me'walksyon July 15, 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "P0mI0uPA1z6DRJWY", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858738479", "lyrics": "How could he know this new dawn's light\n Would change his life forever?\n Set sail to sea, but pulled off course\n By the light of golden treasure\n Was he the one causing pain\n With his careless dreaming?\n Been afraid, always afraid\n Of the things he's feeling\n He\n could\n just\n be\n gone\n He\n would just\n sail on\n He'll just sail on\n \n How can I be lost\n If I've got nowhere to go?\n Search for seas of gold,\n How come it's got so cold?\n How can I be lost,\n In remembrance I relive\n And how can I blame you,\n When it's me I can't forgive?\n These days drift on inside a fog,\n It's thick and suffocating\n \n He's seeking life\n Outside it's hell\n Inside intoxicating\n \n He's run aground\n Like his life\n Water much too shallow\n Slipping fast\n Down with his ship\n Fading in the shadows\n Now\n a\n castaway\n They've\n all gone\n away\n They've gone away\n \n How can I be lost\n If I've got nowhere to go?\n Search for seas of gold,\n How come it's got so cold?\n How can I be lost\n In remembrance I relive\n And how can I blame you?\n When it's me I can't forgive?\n \n Forgive me\n Forgive me not\n Forgive me\n Forgive me not\n \n Forgive me\n Forgive me not\n Forgive me\n Forgive me\n Why can't I forgive me?\n \n Set sail to sea, but pulled off course\n By the light of golden treasure\n How could he know this new dawn's light\n Would change his life forever?\n \n How can I be lost\n If I've got nowhere to go?\n Search for seas of gold\n How come it's got so cold?\n How can I be lost\n In remembrance I relive\n So how can I blame you\n When it's me I can't forgive?", "comment": "i think this song is about smoenoe whos looking for fortune and fame and found it, to realise that its something thats not as he expected. he wanted more out of it. \"Searched the seas of goldHow come it's got so cold\"and at the begining he was good at what he does, thats why in remembrance he lives, cause he was good at what he used to do, then hes not good anymore. and he wont forgive himself for losing his greatness in that thing, but wont blame the people who stopped supporting him. \"How can I be lostIn remembrance I reliveAnd how can I blame youWhen it's me I can't forgive\"hishamassion September 10, 2008\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "P1o1r87NLjlsSDw9", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107859552459", "lyrics": "Finally...\n I'm crossing the threshold\n From the ordinary world\n To the reveal of my heart\n \n Undoubtedly...\n That will for certain\n Take the dead out of the sea\n And the darkness from the arts\n \n This is my commitment\n My modern manifesto\n I'm doing it for all of us\n Who never got the chance\n For... and for...

Notice in the song she sings, \"sometimes I feel like I've got a war in my mind\" which was a line from her song Ride, which was about trying to not let her lonely life get her down so she just goes with life and rides. In this song, she sings about how she had to play someone's game or live her own life which I think means people thought her depression and loneliness wasn't real and her life was perfect from everyone who viewed her that way.

The walls are breathing your foundations are being shaken your mind is unweaving. Maybe you need to be alone to figure this out.

It made me come to terms with drinking and waking up the next morning and not knowing what happened the night before from drinking. All of my dark moments was from the excessive drinking. It's a problem that I play off as nothing. The whole routine is a dark place. I dragged my dark moments with me all the time and still do time to time. I don't want to live like that anymore. So I decided to stop drinking and tell a few people about my problems. It was the best feeling in the world. I'm getting my life back together. I'm \"shaking it out\" and couldn't be happier. In the musical aspect, I think this song is beautiful. It's flawless and you can feel the emotion in it. She never has let me down with anything she ever wrote.

By being with one another, they can leave the past behind them so \"not one speck will remain.\" I think what the singer means by \"roads left in both of [their] shoes\" is that he and his significant other have not only a future together, but also some of their own personal issues to work out. fb2910on February 09, 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "QKfyfZfJZ7Vj4W57", "songmeanings_id": "71598", "lyrics": "So you face it with a smile\n There is no need to cry\n For a trifle's more than this\n \n Will you still recall my name?\n And the month it all began\n Will you release me with a kiss?\n \n Have I tried to draw the veil?\n If I have - how could I fail?\n Did I fear the consequence?\n \n Dazed by careless words\n Cosy in my mind\n \n I don't mind\n I think so\n I will let you go\n \n I don't mind\n I think so\n I will let you go\n \n Now you shaped that liquid wax\n Fit it out with crater cracks\n Sweet devotion, my delight\n \n Oh, you're such a pretty one\n And the naked thrills of flesh and skin\n Would tease me through the night\n \n Now I hate to leave you bare\n If you need me I'll be there\n Don't you ever let me down\n \n Dazed by careless words\n Cosy in my mind\n \n I don't mind\n I think so\n I will let you go\n \n I don't mind\n I think so\n I will let you go\n \n And I touched your face\n Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane\n \n And I called your name\n Like an addicted to cocaine\n Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame\n \n And I touched your face\n Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane\n \n And I called your name\n My cocaine\n I don't mind\n I think so\n I will let you go\n I don't mind\n I think so\n I will let you go\n I don't mind\n I think so\n I will let you go\n I don't mind\n I think so\n I will let you go\n I don't mind", "comment": "i think this song is obviously metaphorical. the person who wrote the lyrics chose to depict his failed (or failing) relationship by relating it to an addiction to narcotics. i definitely think the point of view of this song is from a person who has been dumped, since he talks bout being \"released\", and the tone is obviously bitter...\"so you faced it with a smile...a trifle's more than this\". i'm pretty sure those lines were meant to be sarcastic. i can definitely relate to this song, which makes me like it 9348934 times more. plus, the melody is addicting (no pun intended). :]crg07eon August 17, 2008\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "QOepJEe9aNAqQhW3", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107859466318", "lyrics": "Time shakes, found you at the water\n At first you were my father, now I love you like a brother\n Earthquakes shake the dust behind you\n This world at times will blind you\n Still I know I'll see you there\n \n Come a little closer, then you'll see\n Come on, come on, come on\n Things aren't always what they seem to be\n Come on, come on, come on\n Do you understand the things that you've been seeing\n Come on, come on, come on\n Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming\n \n Come a little closer, then you'll see\n \n Heartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders\n Will we burn or we just smolder\n Somehow I know I'll find you there\n Oooh, I wanna see if you can change it, change it\n Still I know I'll see you there\n \n Come a little closer, then you'll see\n Come on, come on, come on\n Things aren't always what they seem to be\n Do you understand the things that you've been seeing\n Come on, come on, come on\n Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming\n \n Come a little closer, then you'll see\n Come a little closer, then you'll see\n Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh\n \n Ten thousand people stand alone now\n And in the evening the sun sets\n Tomorrow it will rise\n Time flies by, they all sang along\n Time flies by, they all sang along\n Time flies by, they all sang along\n Time flies by by\n Come a little closer, then you'll see\n Come on, come on, come on\n Come a little closer, then you'll see\n Come a little closer, then you'll see\n Come a little closer, then you'll see", "comment": "I think this song is about his relationship with God. The first verse talks about \"found you at the water\" which could signify a baptism. \"At first you were my father/ but now I love you like a brother\" could mean that he acknowledged the existence of God, but then something happened that truly brought him close to God. The choruses could be God talking to him, telling him to look more closely at the beauty of life and the world, and that even if things look bad there can still be good within them. darianb1031on October 27, 2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "QSL5xBNgNEZaTvtc", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858757086", "lyrics": "I live between concrete walls\n When I took her up she was so warm\n I live between concrete walls\n In my arms she was so warm\n \n Eyes are open the mouth cries\n Haven't slept since summer\n Eyes are open the mouth cries\n Haven't slept since summer\n \n I live between concrete walls\n When I took her up she was so warm\n I live between concrete walls\n In my arms she was so warm\n \n Oh, how I try\n I leave the TV on and the radio\n Oh, how I try\n I leave the TV on and the radio\n \n I live between concrete walls\n When I took her up she was so warm\n I live between concrete walls\n In my arms she was so warm", "comment": "The neat thing about Fever Ray is that everyone can relate to it, IN THEIR OWN WAY.

I don't know for sure if there is a specific situation here that the song refers to, but one of the managers for the band kind of screwed them over with their contract and entangled them in this lawsuit.

I think this song is just about learning to forgive someone that has wronged us. How many of us have felt wronged by someone, but at the same time find it hard to forgive that person.

She just gets you to believe that sometimes love isn't enough, like Bryia says. I think of this song whenever I think of someone who's betrayed me. Usually people in your life betray you, leave you, then come back years later, and they seem to have turned over a new leaf, all happy and wonderful.. as if their new love and life has redeemed them for their past betrayals. That's what I think this song is about. By saying \"save your soul,\" it implies that the persons soul needs to be saved in the first place, thus implying that the person hasn't been the most virtuous. She just asks if love is enough to redeem you for fucking someone over. So you turn over a new leaf. So what? She doesn't think love is gonna save you.

I think this song is speaking from the point of view of a person who will not tolerate the kind of mindlessness the American people and the American government are exhibiting right now. \"I'm the voice inside your headYou refuse to hear\"\"Keep you in the darkYou know they all pretend\"\"Done bleeding ignorancein your defense\"I think it's partially about how naive we've been, and also partially how stupid our government has been. It's kind of a \"we're sick of this bullshit\" sorta song. Aimed a lot at the government and the establishment. If you watch the music video it makes sense, there's a line of police/soldier-type figures armed with masks and suits with numbers, in the end the red backdrop explodes onto them.

It's also as if Bella's wanting to tell him things 'you know i haven't slept in weeks, your the only thing i see'. I dont quiet understand the satelite heart.

I personally believe it is about him meeting someone at a blood bank whom he falls in love with after getting into a crash but they don't know how to explain it to each other.

The christmas morning I believe would be them being pulled out of the car and he's delerious. That's the only part that truly throws me for a loop.

Blood as the theme could just represent the ties we all have to each other, the most obvious being to that of family, hence the reference to his brother's blood at the beginning. Then, there is the more secret, surprising connections we find in love that run just as deep but are harder to express, yet seem so simple in places like a cozy car on a snowy day. Love this song, such a beautiful snapshot of life. And the metaphor \"I'm in love with your cheeks\" is just so lovely...it means to me that he loves the girl enough to notice the beauty in the mundane, usually unremarkable features of her. stredferon June 22, 2012\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "S4GRXVFinDlLO46O", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858776850", "lyrics": "If I'm a bad person\n You don't like me\n I guess I'll make my own way.\n It's a circle\n A mean cycle.\n I can't excite you anymore.\n Where's your gavel?\n Your jury?\n What's my offense this time?\n You're not a judge but if you're gonna judge me\n Well, sentence me to another life\n \n Don't wanna hear your sad songs!\n I don't wanna feel your pain!\n When you swear it's all my fault\n But you know we're not the same\n (No!)\n We're not the same!\n (No!)\n Oh, we're not the same!\n Yeah, that the friends who stuck together\n We wrote our names in blood\n But I guess you can't accept\n That the change is good\n (Hey!)\n It's good\n (Hey!)\n It's good\n \n You treat me just like\n Another stranger\n Well, It's nice to meet you, sir!\n I guess I'll go\n I best be on my way out\n \n You treat me just like\n Another stranger\n Well, It's nice to meet you, sir!\n I guess I'll go\n I best be on my way out\n \n Ignorance is your new best friend!\n Ignorance is your new best friend!\n \n This is the best thing\n That could've happened\n Any longer and I wouldn't have made it!\n \n It's not a war\n No, it's not a rapture\n I'm just a person\n But you can't take it\n The same tricks\n That once fooled me\n They won't get you anywhere!\n I'm not the same kid\n From your memory\n Well, now I can fend for myself.\n \n Don't wanna hear your sad songs!\n I don't wanna feel your pain!\n When you swear it's all my fault\n But you know we're not the same\n (No!)\n We're not the same!\n (No!)\n Oh, we're not the same!\n Yeah, we use to stick together\n We wrote our names in blood\n But I guess you can't accept\n That the change is good\n (Hey!)\n It's good\n (Hey!)\n It's good\n \n You treat me just like\n Another stranger\n Well, It's nice to meet you, sir!\n I guess I'll go\n I best be on my way out.\n \n You treat me just like\n Another stranger\n Well, It's nice to meet you, sir!\n I guess I'll go\n I best be on my way out.\n \n Ignorance is your new best friend!\n Ignorance is your new best friend!\n Ignorance is your new best friend!\n Ignorance is your new best friend!\n \n You treat me just like\n Another stranger\n Well, It's nice to meet you, sir!\n I guess I'll go\n I best be on my way out\n You treat me just like\n Another stranger\n Well, It's nice to meet you, sir!\n I guess I'll go\n I best be on my way out.", "comment": "All the personal meaning is something only Hayley will really ever know. But in search of a more general meaning we can all relate to, I think this song is about a best friend who's sort of ditched or defriended you without explanation, most likely saying that you've \"changed\". Which doesn't really explain things since we all change in life. I think it's about being just pissed off and hurt that someone you used to call a best friend would just judge you and turn on you like that.

We get to an age where we realize we have to stop being kids and start being adults and it scares us. Life is so simple when we are young because we are free to dream, play, explore and pretend but when you become an adult the real world starts and happiness ends. Family and childhood friends go their separate ways, you have to get a boring job that you hate, you have to get married and start a family, and you have responsibilities you didn't have before. So the solution for some people is to pretend that life is still as easy as it was when they were kids.

But he's all in, he would have no hesitation about being with her. Every part of him says go ahead. Maybe the friendship has been a long one. He decided long ago how he feels about her, any indecision comes from her. And when she says hi to him, asks him to hang out, asks him to help her with something, he gets his hopes up. She doesn't show any indication of having feelings for him - he hopes that doesn't mean she doesn't have feelings for him, he wants it to be that she does have feelings for him and she just doesn't show it.

The man doesn't want to intentionally hurt her and the yelling at the end is him expressing his frustration because she is most likely upset that their physical encounterS didn't amount to what she wants. I think he feels tricked into coming over for one thing and now it is turning into something else. In the end, her offering herself to him physically even thought it won't amount to anything is what makes her available. The man will keep coming over for the sex and she will continue to hope/wish/try to make it more.

I think this song is definitely about his former self, when he was on drugs; the song addresses who he had become as a drug addict, told from both sides (as the addict, and the recovering). But that line... just sounds like a plea to the \"real\" him, the one who was always there. That simple, inexplicable joy of dancing when everything has lost meaning, and you've lost yourself in drugs. The \"fond farewell\", I think, refers to that feeling of missing a drug that a former addict always has, no matter how bad things were when he/she was using, or how long he/she's been clean (so I've heard). It's what tempts long-sober people back for \"just one hit\", because they're so desperate to get that feeling just once more. itchy92on September 14, 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "TSvIUYbVc09nGhqA", "songmeanings_id": "680", "lyrics": "She's made of hair and bone and little teeth\n And things that I cannot speak\n She comes on like a crippled plaything\n Her spine is just a string\n \n I wrapped our love in all this foil\n Silver tight like spider legs\n I never wanted it to ever spoil\n But flies will always lay their eggs\n \n Take your hatred out on me\n Make your victim my head\n You never ever believed in me\n I am your tourniquet\n \n Prosthetic synthesis with butterfly\n Sealed up with virgin stitch\n If it hurts baby please tell me\n Preserve the innocence\n I never wanted it to end like this\n But flies will lay their eggs\n \n Take your hatred out on me\n Make your victim my head\n You never ever believed in me\n I am your tourniquet\n \n What I wanted, what I needed\n What I got for me\n What I wanted, what I needed\n What I got for me\n \n Take your hatred out on me\n Make your victim my head\n You never ever believed in me\n I am your tourniquet\n \n Take your, take your\n Hatred out on me\n I'm not proud with me\n I never ever believed in me\n I am your tourniquet", "comment": "I think this song is about a passive agressive relationship. \"she's a crippled plaything\" represents her passiveness or maliable mind; he says \"i am your tournequet\", meaning he works through her like a god and her own life supply is cut off. the whole relationship is based on his inability to find his own self esteem,so it is replaced by his deep need for her to believe in him like a god. the \"flies will lay their eggs\" thing is about the incubation period for her mind to change to his influence. he feels that without this relationship, the attention he gets from her, he, as a person, would be devoid of meaning. bellyflooron April 23, 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "TXgG5OjHQUK19FRs", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858485012", "lyrics": "When all is said and done\n And dead does he love you\n The way that I do\n Breathing in lighting\n Tonight's for fighting\n I feel the hurt so physical\n \n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around I'll let you feel the burn\n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around come around no more\n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around I'll let you feel the burn\n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around no more\n \n She spreads her love\n She burns me up\n I can't let go\n I can't get out\n I've said enough\n Enough by now\n I can't let go\n I can't get out\n \n Wait till the day you finally see\n I've been here waiting patiently\n Crossing my fingers and my t's\n She cried on my shoulder begging please\n \n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around I'll let you feel the burn\n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around come around no more\n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around I'll let you feel the burn\n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around no more\n \n She spreads her love\n She burns me up\n I can't let go\n I can't get out\n I've said enough\n Enough by now\n I can't let go\n I can't get out\n \n What is it you really want?\n I'm tired of asking\n You come wasted\n \n When I showed up and he was there\n I tried my best to grin and bear\n And took the stairs but didn't stop at the street\n And as we speak I'm going down\n \n Cause she spread her love\n And burnt me up\n I can't let go\n I can't get out\n I've said enough\n Enough by now\n I can't let go\n I can't get out\n \n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around I'll let you feel the burn\n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around come around no more\n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around I'll let you feel the burn\n Think twice before you touch my girl\n Come around no more", "comment": "ok i think this song is about a guy and his girlfriend being happy together but then this guy trys to mess around with her . and so the guy is telling him you better think before you touch my girl cuz if you do im gonna kick your assand so the guy messes with the girl any way and so they two guys are gonna fight and when he says\"And took the stairs but didn't stop at the street and as we speak I'm goin down \"that means he took the stairs passed the street to go DOWN and fight the guynot meaning going down like losing but going down to kick the guys assthats what i think!!!

He is the silent kid looking down the barrel, watching his mom getting hurt. She doesn't want to know where he is because then he is ia witness or a victim. And she has been trying not to cry, to not show him how bad it is, but Elliott/Pitseleh is crying, he knows exactly what is going on. But then later, when he sings the last verse, he is addressing it to someone he wants to love, but knowing what he has lived through, he will be bad news for her. He often spoke about being abused and started a foundation for abused kids, and left his mother's house to go live with his father because of his stepfather.

At first I thought it was clearly about looking down a gun's barrel to commit suicide, but after a lot of listening to Elliott's other songs, I think it also means to stare down the barrel of a syringe, and the \"noise that I kept so quiet\" means to keep his addiction a secret as well as keep his suicidal thoughts a secret.

The soldier abroad and all he represents and how the image and idea of Rita functioned to keep each one going, battling to return to a love back home. Once home the love they held on to was often gone leaving them with the ghost of what life was before war and for many of the women waiting their ultimate fate was to be in love with a fallen mans ghost. hbthompson October 04, 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "UNshO7ZVwub48OoT", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858604875", "lyrics": "Pain, without love\n Pain, I can't get enough\n Pain, I like it rough\n 'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all\n \n You're sick of feeling numb\n You're not the only one\n I'll take you by the hand\n And I'll show you a world that you can understand.\n This life is filled with hurt\n When happiness doesn't work\n Trust me and take my hand\n When the lights go out you will understand...\n \n Pain, without love\n Pain, I can't get enough\n Pain, I like it rough\n 'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all\n \n Pain, without love\n Pain, I can't get enough\n Pain, I like it rough\n 'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all\n \n Anger and agony\n Are better than misery\n Trust me I've got a plan\n When the lights go off you will understand.\n \n Pain, without love\n Pain, I can't get enough\n Pain, I like it rough\n 'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all\n \n Pain, without love\n Pain, I can't get enough\n Pain, I like it rough\n 'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing\n Rather feel pain\n I know (I know I know I know I know)\n That you're wounded\n You know (You know you know you know you know)\n That I'm here to save you\n You know (You know you know you know you know)\n I'm always here for you\n I know (I know I know I know I know)\n That you'll thank me later\n \n Pain, without love\n Pain, can't get enough\n Pain, I like it rough\n 'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all\n \n Pain, without love\n Pain, I can't get enough\n Pain, I like it rough\n 'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all\n Pain, without love\n Pain, I can't get enough\n Pain, I like it rough\n 'Cause I'd rather feyel pain than nothing at all\n Rather feel pain than nothing at all\n Rather feel pain...", "comment": "i think this song is talking about emotional pain. it sounds from the song that he was in a constant state of depression for awhile. i know that when im depressed for awhile i start hurting too much inside to care. it becomes normal and i like the pain of feeling depressed. i think thats where he was when he wrote this song. i mean if the albums is supposed to get acrss the emotions for being on tour for a long time and not knowing anyone outside of the tour bus, then i would get pretty depressed myself. i would think he would too. dothedew08on July 25, 2006\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "UTFkBfaFJXu5rV1d", "songmeanings_id": "3595", "lyrics": "I was angry when I met you\n I think I'm angry still\n We can try to talk it over\n If you say you'll help me out\n \n Don't worry baby\n No need to fight\n Don't worry baby\n We'll be all right\n \n This is the noise that keeps me awake\n My head explodes and my body aches\n \n Push it\n Make the beats go harder\n Push it\n Make the beats go harder\n \n I'm sorry that I hurt you\n Please don't ask me why\n I want to see you happy\n I want to see you shine\n \n Don't worry baby\n Don't be uptight\n Don't worry baby\n We'll stay up all night\n \n This is the noise that keeps me awake\n My head explodes and my body aches\n \n Push it\n Make the beats go harder\n Push it\n Make the beats go harder\n \n C'mon push it, you can do it\n C'mon prove it, nothing to it\n C'mon use it, let's get through it\n C'mon push it, you can do it\n \n Don't worry baby\n Don't be uptight\n Don't worry baby\n We'll stay up all night\n \n This is the noise that keeps me awake\n My head explode and my body aches\n \n Push it\n Make the beats go harder\n Push it\n (This is the noise that keeps me awake)\n Make the beats go harder\n (My head explodes and my body aches)\n Push it\n (This is the noise that keeps me awake)\n Make the beats go harder\n Push it\n (This is the noise that keeps me awake)\n Make the beats go harder\n (My head explodes and my body aches)\n \n Push it\n Make the beats go harder\n Push it\n Make the beats go harder\n \n Push it\n Make the beats go harder\n Push it\n Make the beats go harder\n \n Don't worry baby\n We'll be alright\n Don't worry baby\n We'll be alright\n \n Push it\n Push it\n Push it\n Push it\n Push it", "comment": "Personally I think this song is about having a fight with someone and getting angry, and loving it. When she sings the stuff like \"Sorry that I hurt you.. etc\" she is being sarcastic and patronizing, like you would in a heated argument with someone. And when she sings the chorus \"this is the noise that keeps me awake...\" she is singing about how much she loves the part when both people crack and go crazy and angry. \"Push it, make the beats go harder\" - Basically, keep pushing me. Make my heart beat faster/harder, I like it. Make me angry. Piss me off. Soooo like.. She is singing about how everyone is programmed to be excited by a little action. It's human nature I guess.. So whether you like it or not, everyone likes arguing. Everyone likes being pissed off and pissing others off. Maybe that's just from a teenagers point of view..Oh wellGood song.

When you love someone, tell them everyday that you do because you don't know if they will be here tomorrow.

Scary how this song is so blatant but the meaning is buried in plain site under the religious debate. martina100on March 29, 2016\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "V7EIainnHShh2PVW", "songmeanings_id": "61898", "lyrics": "Something's happening\n Don't speak to soon\n I told the boss off and made my move\n Got no where to go\n \n Son of Sam, son of that shining path, the clouded mind\n Couple killer each and every time\n \n I'm not uncomfortable, feeling weird\n Long revered options disappear\n But I know what to do\n \n Son of Sam, son of a doctor's touch, a nurse's love\n Acting under orders from above\n \n King for a day\n \n Son of Sam, son of that shining path, the clouded mind\n Couple killer running out of time\n \n Shiva opens her arms now\n To make sure I don't get too far\n I may talk in my sleep tonight cause I don't know what I am\n I'm a little like you, more like Son of Sam", "comment": "I can't help but think this song is about David Berkowitz (Son of Sam.) This guy ran around killing women in the 70's. \"couple killer each and every time\"\"acting under orders from above\"\"the clouded mind\"all references to BerkowitzBerkowitz claimed demons controlled him and a talking dog told him to kill the girls. He later told the truth in prison that he really killed these women because of his shit relationships with his mom/other women and he would masturbate after killing these women. Berkowitz claims to be sorry for everything he did as of 2002, he's rotting away in jail and claims to be a Christian now. As far as the reference to Shiva, she would be more..creative than destructive. I guess maybe this song is about good vs evil type of thing? The whole \"Shiva opens her arms now to make sure I don't get too far\" I guess too far out of her reach. Maybe he's saying he's creatively destroying himself. I mean, he did kill himself in the end. He was awesome though.

And the still-homophobic slant many media forms have, which leads many people to still refusing to accept or acknowledge gay people. \"Daddy it's true, I'm different from you / But tell me why they treat me like this / You turn away, what could I say / Not the first betrayed by a kiss\" - this references Judas' kiss of Jesus in a very clever way. In this song the homosexual kiss between two men reveals the protagonist as gay, it effectively outs him. The Daddy referred to here and in this song is, I suspect, God. \"They're down on their knees / Begging us please / Praying that we don't exist\" - refers to the intolerance religion still has towards gay people. niteflite01on October 27, 2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "VTQ2quBZPMXGuojP", "songmeanings_id": "41", "lyrics": "Something takes a part of me\n Something lost and never seen\n Every time I start to believe\n Something's raped and taken from me from me\n \n Life's gotta always be messing with me\n (You wanna see the light)\n Can't they chill and let me be free\n (So do I)\n Can't I take away all this pain\n (You wanna see the light)\n I try to every night, all in vain, in vain\n Sometimes I cannot take this place\n Sometimes it's my life I can't taste\n Sometimes I cannot feel my face\n You'll never see me fall from grace\n \n Something takes a part of me\n You and I were meant to be\n A cheap fuck for me to lay\n Something takes a part of me\n Feeling like a freak on a leash\n (You wanna see the light)\n Feeling like I have no release\n (So do I)\n How many times have I felt diseased\n (You wanna see the light)\n Nothing in my life is free, is free\n \n Sometimes I cannot take this place\n Sometimes it's my life I can't taste\n Sometimes I cannot feel my face\n You'll never see me fall from grace\n \n Something takes a part of me\n You and I were meant to be\n A cheap fuck for me to lay\n Something takes a part of me\n \n Boom na da noom na na nema\n Da boom na da noom na namena\n Da boom na ba noom na namena\n Da boom na da noom na namena\n Da boom na ba noom na namena\n Da boom na da noom na namena\n Da boom na ba noom na namena\n Da boom na da noom na namena\n Da boom na ba noom na namena\n Da boom na da noom na namena\n Da boom na ba noom na namena\n Da boom na da noom na namena\n Go!\n \n So fight!

She wants to end it and he's begging her to just stay with him. Even if she is just using him, he's at the point where any intimacy with her is enough. We have all been there. You will let a person use you just for those few moments you have with them. It's one of the most degrading, painful experiences and that's why i think this song is so meaningful. He let's her walk all over him because he just wants those few moments together. Even though he knows that the whole situation is wrong and he's tormented inside over it, he doesn't have the strength to walk away. Which is why he tells her to be the one to stay away. mmm so relatable. the only thing you can do is tell the person to get out of your life because seeing him is too hard.

As for imagrey and allusion, theres not so much of that. But I suppose it reminds one of the praries, the straight country roads that go on for long distances. Now, if you anything about Tom Cochrane, he was born in the Friendly Manitoba, Canada and then relocated to Ontario. So he's got a definite country roads feeling. So I urge you to think of this song in the praries, it paints a great picture. paigepeachon October 24, 2006\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "WGm8CU7iWc7j9Kzf", "songmeanings_id": "37905", "lyrics": "The world was on fire and no-one could save me but you\n It's strange what desire will make foolish people do\n I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you\n And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you\n \n No, I don't wanna fall in love\n \n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n No, I don't wanna fall in love\n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n With you\n \n With you\n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way\n What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you\n \n What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way\n What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you\n And I don't wanna fall in love\n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n No, I don't wanna fall in love\n \n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n With you\n \n The world was on fire, no one could save me but you\n It's strange what desire will make foolish people do\n \n I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you\n And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you\n No, I don't wanna fall in love\n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n No, I don't wanna fall in love\n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n With you\n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n With you\n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n No, I...\n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n (This world is only gonna break your heart)\n Nobody loves no one", "comment": "i think this song is about unrequited love. the guy/ girl loves someone they can't have but want so badly it's painful\"World was on fire, no one could save me but youIt's strange what desire will make foolish people doI'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like youNo, I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like youNo, I don't wanna fall in love\"The person who is in love is also angry at the object of their afeection cos they feel it is their fault that they are in love with them.

He has developped a deluded sense of who he is and he needs to obtain an outside objective look at what he has become (\"reminding which lies that I've been hiding [what is not true], which echoes belong [which is the true him]\").

That you shouldn't stay silent when something wrong is done - you should raise your voice, be brave and never give up on your believes. You have to be loud to be heard, and you need to be heard to save as much in this world as possible.

Everything on the outside seems to be in place, but shadow and stranger imagery suggest that this person is floundering, unable to connect. The lover/singer is desperately trying to connect, hold the hand inside of someone who has yet to come to grips with themselves. They are not ready, still blind. It is so tragic to love someone like this. I have. This is the person who cannot give back. They sabotage themselves, colors their eyes with what's not there. The object of this song deep down cannot understand why anyone would love them. \"strange you never knew\" refers to this sense of self loathing and doubt. This person cannot see themselves as lovable even though the love is so real to the singer. Tragic.

When he says:\"I gave you everything to die with a smile. All u wanted was to live for a while.\" I think he means that he wanted a serious relationship. As in, he wanted to be with her untill they died. He have her everything so they could be together untill one of them died, but she didn't want things to get serious. She just wanted the relationship to last for a little while. Have some fun together, but nothing more. That could be completly wrong, but who knows? Also, I think the line\"As your walking away, your footsteps get louder.\" Means that the less she talks to him the more he wants her, or when she breaks up with him it makes him only want her more. I'm sure 90% of us can relate to that. Maybe the line\"You watch me bleed.\" Means that she see his hurting, but she does nothing about it. She dosn't care about him or his feelings. Anyone else have a better idea?

He doesn't think he's seeing the real things to life, then he picks up and leaves his family to a foreign country possibly Africa and there he apparently finds God. (2nd and 3rd) as far as the Chorus I think while he's in this strange place he is asking someone to watch out for him in exchange for his friendship. Basically I think its about Paul being in Africa and sort of finding himself. anakin821on March 04, 2003\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "Wg66sqvEiee6KFyk", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858746800", "lyrics": "Hold on, hold on\n Let me get the words out before I burst\n There's no truth at all\n Poking at the giant eyes of ancient Gods\n \n Cool heads have failed\n Now it's time for me to have my turn\n Kiss me, kiss me\n Life is way too short to scream and shout\n \n Flashed up in my wildest dreams the dark red blood streams\n Stretching out like vast cracked ice\n The veins of you, the veins of me like great forest trees\n Pushing through and on and in\n \n Gliding like a satellite in the broken night\n And when I wake you're there, I'm saved\n Your love is life piled tight and high, set against the sky\n That seems to balance on it's own\n \n Sing out, sing out\n The silence only eats us from the inside up\n I meant no harm\n But I only get to say these words too late\n \n Wake up, wake up\n Dreaming only leads to more and more nightmares\n Snap out of it\n You said it in a way that showed you really cared\n \n Flashed up in my wildest dreams the dark red blood streams\n Stretching out like vast cracked ice\n The veins of you, the veins of me like great forest trees\n Pushing through and on and in\n \n Gliding like a satellite in the broken night\n And when I wake you're there, I'm saved\n Your love is life piled tight and high set against the sky\n That seems to balance on it's own\n \n Send your Lifeboats out for me\n Send your Lifeboat out\n Send your Lifeboats out for me\n Send your Lifeboat out\n \n Send your Lifeboats out for me\n Send your Lifeboat out\n Send your Lifeboats out for me\n Send your Lifeboat out", "comment": "I think this song is about a spiritual awaking. It is when you challenge old beliefs of yourself or others. At the start of the song, 'let me get the words out before I burn' means I am going to challenge you ancient gods. He is literally saying to the gods, there is not truth in what you say. As the song goes on, he is fighting with himself inside philosophically. He is trying to find out just what his spirituality is or what he believes in. Since many are scared to say how they feel in religious or spiritual aspects, this is what he means by 'Silence only eats from the inside out'. He wants to share with the world his beliefs without being ridiculed or chastised by society or family. 'Send you lifeboats for me' for me means he wants to be accepted and loved no matter what he believes in. From the lyrics to this song, I think the singer takes a more scientific few on life than spiritual.

When I first heard this song and really heard the lyrics I noticed it sounded like the LOTF anthem. The song mentions the beast watching over them, just like the imagined beast in the book. And it also mentions about a ship not coming for them, which happened in the book. Also, the boys on the island have to believe they will be rescued and all though its hard to breathe and focus they have to get a way back to their home. So, this song could be about real life truth and etc but then again this song could be based on LOTF, because its an inspirational book.

You need that person to stay with you. You want this person to be your prize for making it through all the heartache. I think these lyrics are great because it says so much by saying so little. They are simple, easily relateable for anyone, and gives a deep emotion.

Most people think this song is about a relationship, but i think it's very different. I think its more of a wolf story such as \"Little red riding hood\". The line \"You had a boyfriendWho looked like a girlfriend\" is a reference to \"little red riding hood\" because the grandma looked like a wolf cus she actually was. The wolf ate the grandmother and wore her clothes, this symbolizes how the wolf was a transvestite and perhaps a homosexual. touchmapaynuson July 19, 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "Y0CT4GNu77jLCm4B", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858560516", "lyrics": "Superstition taking all of us for a ride\n Mines overtaken by the signs of the right\n The bombs are falling overhead with no sight\n While you are talking all detached, so tell us\n \n Where you going?\n To the bottom\n Do you hear us?\n We are rotting\n \n We're going down in a spiral to the ground\n No one, no one's gonna save us now\n \n Ceremonies have killed religions for they provide\n The masked comforts to delusionals, they're all in fright\n The true believer's head was bathed in sunlight\n While you are walking all detached, so tell us\n \n Where you going?\n To the bottom\n Do you hear us?\n We are rotting\n \n We're going down in a spiral to the ground\n No one, no one's gonna save us now\n Not even God, no one saved us\n No one's gonna save us\n \n Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?\n Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?\n Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall?\n Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?\n \n Superstition taking all of us for a ride\n Mines overtaken by the signs of the right\n The bombs are falling overhead with no sight\n While you are talking all detached,\n detached, detached, detached, detached\n We're going down in a spiral to the ground\n No one, no one's gonna save us now\n (Not even God)\n No one saved us, no one saved us\n No one saved us, no one's gonna save us now\n Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?.", "comment": "I think this song is about the truth of corruption. We live in a world where no one is accepted for how they feel or what they believe in. Daron seems to be hinting on the fact that God is most likely sickened by the thought that we take other people's belief and, literally, attack them in physical ways. That's how wars start. It's all arguments with origin over beliefs of the unknown, and it's messed up in countless ways. War is a joke, and there's no point to it. Go ahead and say what you want, but it NEVER does anything to benefit society in any way. It just makes people develop more hatred towards one another, eventually leading to the inevitable outcome of war. Iraq never did anything to us, and yet we thrive on the fact that our society differs from them, and we therefore bomb them.

He's put her on her pedestal because so far she's been responsive to these needs. But would he still want to be together if it meant just simply \"being\" with her for a change?

I love all the melodic breaks. I think this song is about the constant conflict that is life. Individuals struggle against individuals, groups of people struggle with another, countries fight other countries. Animals struggle with each other, with people, with environmental degradation. Even within families, there are struggles to be heard, and struggles for love, appreciation and respect. One must be prepared for conflict at all turns. The fight to control and to not be controlled is evident at all levels of life, and it is unrelenting. Even the laws of thermodynamics suggest that one must constantly do battle in order to maintain one's integrity. I think this song captures this beautifully, from the grinding verses to the sparks of melodic beauty in the chorus and breaks. There are always pockets of victory and beauty strewn amongst the conflict. Those moments are to be savored, especially because they are fleeting."}, {"music4all_id": "YStgiZpspJrRXuoK", "songmeanings_id": "18448", "lyrics": "I'm tearing away\n Pieces are falling I can't seem to make them stay\n You run away\n Faster and faster you can't seem to get away\n Break\n Hope there's a reason\n For questions unanswered I just don't see everything\n Yes I'm inside you\n Tell me how does it feel to feel like this\n Just like I do\n I don't care about anyone else but me\n I don't care about anyone\n I don't care about anyone else but me\n I don't care about anyone\n Do I really want this\n Sometimes I scare myself I just can't let it go\n Can you believe it\n Everything happens for reasons I just don't know\n I don't care about anyone else but me\n I don't care about anyone\n I don't care about anyone else but me\n I don't care about anyone or anything\n I don't care about anyone but me\n God damn I love me\n I don't care about anyone else but me\n I don't care about anyone\n I don't care about anyone else but me\n I don't care about anyone or anything\n I don't care about anyone else but me\n I don't care about anyone", "comment": "As egotistical it might seem at a first glance, I think this song is more about a person who was overly optimisitc, or overly trusting, and their hopes were crushed or the person they put their trust into betrayed them.

As she watches the storm brew she urges those on the boat to leave, but it has already happened. The motif \"get out of the waves! Get out of the water\" comes in here and I think this is the sign she is being rescued - it is shouted in Waking the Witch from the helicopter.

I see the bit about \"beautiful people, beautiful girls\" referring to the models and larger-than-life pin-ups we are bombarded with today. I don't think this song is about suicide, because as someone who has 5 of PJ's albums and some of the harder-to-find songs downloaded, I think she would be more creative and original if she were to write about suicide.

She tells him to concentrate on the things he does like, and that's the way to fully enjoy life. Suddenly his mind is wondering, he's happy, he's successful, he's 'made it' (talking to Terry Wogan). The anxiety has gone, his confidence has grown, he's found his voice (My words and smile are so easy now). The chorus is about wanting to bunk off school and go to a matinee with said girl.

I think this song is about lost love, and the vulnerability of admitting to the loved one that there has been a betrayal of neglect, which hurts so much, because it is foreign to the essence of pure love. Sarah is singing about the travails of recognizing that the loved one has neglected and harmed the subject, and doesn't seem to care. However, it's important for the subject to communicate the depth of the damage. The subject is ambushed by the neglect, and doesn't know how to cope with it, yet feels it's important to convey the pain. Moving on is not ideal, but also a recognition that the love interest of the subject has already done so, but failed to consider the feelings or damage of the subject, by neglecting to share. This is a very sad song, brilliantly written and sung to express the heartbreak that is the theme.

Then, they realize that love is so much bigger then what they originally thought. The fire, or love, consumes them. So they take out their hearts, which are nothing but \"little stones\" and try to make them produce what they are feeling. They strike and strike until finally the hearts produce sparks, or love. By doing this, they are breaking free from the formula and proving that there is no true way to make love happen or work. musicgal121on July 20, 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "ZpSDIXI23dQ6OdoV", "songmeanings_id": "7768", "lyrics": "There's a lady who's sure\n All that glitters is gold\n And she's buying a stairway\n To heaven\n \n When she gets there she knows\n If the stores are all closed\n With a word she can get\n What she came for\n \n U-u-u u-u-u-hu\n And she's buying a stairway to heaven\n \n There's a sign on the wall\n But she wants to be sure\n 'Cause you know sometimes\n Words have two meanings\n \n In a tree by the brook\n There's a songbird who sings\n Sometimes all of our thoughts\n Are misgiven\n \n U-uh, it makes me wonder\n U-uh, it makes me wonder\n \n There's a feeling I get\n When I look to the west\n And my spirit is crying\n For leaving\n \n In my thoughts I have seen\n Rings of smoke through the trees\n And the voices of those\n Who stand looking\n \n U-uh, makes me wonder\n U-uh, really makes me wonder\n \n And it's whispered that soon\n If we all call the tune\n Then the piper will lead\n Us to reason\n \n And a new day will dawn\n For those who stand long\n And the forests will echo\n With laughter\n \n If there's a bustle in your hedgerow\n Don't be alarmed now\n It's just a spring clean for the May Queen\n Yes, there are two paths you can go by\n But in the long run\n There's still time to change the road you're on\n \n And it makes me wonder\n \n Your head is humming and it won't go\n In case you don't know\n The piper's calling you to join him\n Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow\n And did you know\n Your stairway lies on the whispering wind\n \n And as we wind on down the road\n Our shadows taller than our soul\n There walks a lady we all know\n Who shines white light and wants to show\n How everything still turns to gold\n And if you listen very hard\n The tune will come to you at last\n When all are one and one is all\n To be a rock and not to roll\n \n And she's buying a stairway to heaven", "comment": "i think this song is far more than memories.i think the lady mentioned in the song is actually a spiritual pursuer who is dying to get her soul to heaven.yet the writer of the lyrics sees it differently.he thinks that all the pursuits are done in vain and the truth that will finally lead you to heaven has always been there ,in the brook,in the trees,in the wind,and in all the simple,little things we used to neglect.therefore,i consider this song as a reminder to those who have lost themselves in their spirtual pursuit. vickieon July 04, 2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "ZxCrTfBCfU0xvFEs", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858796326", "lyrics": "Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh\n As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh\n Oh I'm a lucky man, to count on both hands the ones I love\n Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they've got none, uh-huh\n \n Stay with me...\n Let's just breathe...\n \n Practiced are my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh\n Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh\n I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed\n \n Stay with me\n You're all I see...\n \n Did I say that I need you?\n Did I say that I want you?\n Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see\n No one knows this more than me\n \n As I come clean...\n I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh\n Everything you gave\n And nothing you would take, oh no\n \n Nothing you would take\n Everything you gave...\n \n Did I say that I need you?\n Oh, did I say that I want you?\n Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see\n No one knows this more than me\n And I come clean, ah...\n \n Nothing you would take\n Everything you gave\n Hold me 'til I die\n Meet you on the other side...", "comment": "I think this song is heart-wrenchingly beautiful.

Society always puts constraints into lesbian sex, as to who is the guy, and who is the girl. I think by saying she wants to be your G.U.Y. (girl under you) she is playing with the idea of being the submissive one (girl), but still being dominant enough (she's strong enough to know the truth) to be a \"guy\". That has been my take on the song since the first time I heard it, and based off Venus, and other songs on this album, I'd say the interpretation is at least somewhat close to her intention. It's definitely a sexual song, no doubt about that!

If you watch her video, you can see famous figures such as Michael Jackson, Ghandi, Jesus. She wants to be just as famous and important as these influential men were. In another scene in the video you can see them taking blood from these people and injecting them into Gaga. This is great social commentary in my opinion. Her songs and videos definitely have more layers and meaning than most think.

He wrote this about the death of his mother, and how she finally escaped the mundane tasks that ruled her life. In my view however, when I first listened to this is, its about loving someone so much that when they finally return in your life, you can't help but still love them for who they are. The type of individual that Pat describes in the song is someone who likes to travel, taste new flavours of life. For me the song has a lot of significance as Jupiter is the ruling planet of Sagittarius and the man I can relate this song to is one (just a personal side note haha). Often many people look for something better, and then realise what they left is what they needed and so desired. Thats what I think this song is about. sailorfruiton September 22, 2016\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "adKDEOs1SJ0Kto2Y", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858866129", "lyrics": "If I never get back home,\n There's no garden overgrown,\n No widows in the walls,\n No widows left alone,\n \n No shirts to hang or fold,\n No kid out in the cold,\n No widows on the walls,\n No widows on the phone.\n \n If I'm stuck out here alone,\n If I'm stranded here all year,\n With just nothing left at home,\n No widows disappear.\n \n If the wheels jump off the road,\n There's no widows left to know,\n No perfect love above,\n No punishment below.\n \n When they shake, say the wings won't break.\n When they shake, say the wings won't break.\n \n If I'm stuck out here alone,\n If I'm stranded here all year,\n With just nothing left at home,\n No widows disappear.\n \n If the wheels jump off the road,\n There's no widows left to know,\n No perfect love above,\n No punishment below.\n \n When they shake, say the wings won't break.\n When they shake, say the wings won't break.", "comment": "Wow, I just heard this song, and it is absolutely haunting and beautiful. At its core, I think this song is about the serenity of being alone. As I heard the lyrics, I imagined a soldier somewhere in a foreign land. He has no one waiting for him back at home. If he dies in his vehicle (If the wheels jump off the road) or shot down in the sky (Say the wings won't break) there will be no one waiting for him to come back home. Although this sounds depressing, I think he finds some peace in this (No perfect love above, There's no punishment below).

He did lose his virginity at an early age, like twelve or thirteen, to his one of his father's young girlfriends. He wasn't forced to do it -- his father had been raised in a very religious, restricted home and had his first time with a prostitute, so he didn't want Anthony to go through anything similiar. Anthony told his father he liked the girl, and wanted to have sex with her, and it happened. I don't think this song is about that specific event. He mentioned that when he wrote this song, he was just thinking about past patterns and the girls he may have hurt, partly due to his father's example. lilybarton October 31, 2004\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "ahgTbP8KtJZScXkw", "songmeanings_id": "13116", "lyrics": "I am a man\n Cut from the know\n Rarely do friends\n Come and then go\n \n She was a girl\n Soft but estranged\n We were the two\n Our lives rearranged\n \n Feeling so good that day\n A feeling of love that day\n \n Twisting and turning\n Your feelings are burning\n You're breaking the girl\n (She meant you no harm)\n \n Think you're so clever\n But now you must sever\n You're breaking the girl\n (He loves no one else)\n \n Raised by my dad\n Girl of the day\n He was my man\n That was the way\n \n She was the girl\n Left alone\n Feeling the need\n To make me her home\n \n I don't know what, when or why\n The twilight of love had arrived\n \n Twisting and turning\n Your feelings are burning\n You're breaking the girl\n (She meant you no harm)\n \n Think you're so clever\n But now you must sever\n You're breaking the girl\n (He loves no one else)\n \n Twisting and turning\n Your feelings are burning\n You're breaking the girl\n (She meant you no harm)\n \n Think you're so clever\n But now you must sever\n You're breaking the girl\n (He loves no one else).", "comment": "The reason I love music is because it has the ability to mean different things to different people.

It's devastating and crippling of the soul and mentality of the person who's never had a closer, more intimate connection.

It has a new sound that Coldplay has never done before. I think this song is about how when we are little we think the world is a fairytale. When little girls are asked what they want to be when they grow up, they say a princess or ballerina. When she grows up, these thoughts fade away. She matures and realizes that life is not a fairytale. In the back of her mind she wishes she was a little girl still. \"It ran away from her reach\" meaning that she moved on and she is growing up. \"Life goes on, gets so heavy, the wheel breaks the butterfly.\" The butterfly, I think is the little girl mind. When she grows up, her mind becomes less creative and more realistic. She might still have dreams about being a little girl. Dreams are where she can be whatever she wants.

To me it's one of the most powerful songs on the entire album. Not to mention musically genius. I think this song is about falling for someone who knows nothing about you.

You think about them all day, every day. And if you could only let them know how you truly felt then maybe something could happen. MAYBE they would fall for you too.

All the other lyrics seem to support my theory, it's all about family and nostalgia. As a foster kid myself in the situation outlined above, I've always felt I could identify with this song.

In Bono's universe, I think the word \"city\" is interchangeable with \"world\". The \"world\" is full of lovers and lies. The big lie in the world is that there is no God, and everything just sort of exploded out of thin air, for no reason at all. The main character in this song is Sadie. But she could really be anybody. Apparently she's never thought about God or why she is really here on earth. She's living her life, going through the motions. She's beginning to realize that life is pretty pointless when you have no purpose or higher calling. So she's on the 48th floor thinking about commiting suicide. But Bono tells her to \"surrender.\" I think he is saying that she should surrender her life to God. Just let God handle all of her problems. But it's hard to do this, because the \"city\" or world is so much fun. It's hard to think about God. There's so much \"fun\" stuff to see and do. Why do we need God?

With that in mind, I would also like to say that I don't think this song is directly to a specific gender. It's one of those wonderfully ambiguous songs that can address both genders and both hetero- and homosexual couples. Also, I love the Egyptian sounding melodic line he uses. It really adds something to the song, which went very interestingly with my previous opinion that this had something to do with forbidden relationships, such as in a church or school.

People are very diverse so connections we make with the people we meet, and human interactions in general are intriguing. You can feel at home in a place simply remembering all the people you've made connections with there. Not many people take the time to remember and appreciate these things, perhaps that is why the \"Madam\" at the begginning asks if she is lost because she is \"just wandering\" and remembering. I think when she talks about the people and the governement and two words colliding that she is refering to the division we create by taking opposing sides (can be applied to government parties). Then the whole thing about \"shows that we ain't gonna stand shit...\" I think she is saying that \"we are united\" in \"not taking the shit\" that extremists of any identifying group can try to sell.

think this song is about being fed up with your life...and pretending that your comfortable about where you are to others but fighting a battle within yourself from actually doing anything. you want to change for yourself but then stay the same for everyone else. learning to fly is like learning to break away and do things for yourself. i know this is like nothing to do with what anybody else has really put but hey thats what it means to me. !/bexmcr123on May 24, 2007\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "dDyJBl7FGVK0IaSE", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858631778", "lyrics": "Well, I was

Kind of spitefully saying \"Well you did this to me, and you hurt me really badly, and now I'm here and I can sing these sad songs for the world while all you can do is your sad little job.\" The life long wait for a hospital stay, I think, is just life in general, in the end all coming down to a possibly triumphant, but also possibly quiet and overall \"disappointing\" death.

The couple has that new little obsession with each other where they can't stop thinking about the possibility of the relationship. mclaurinon January 03, 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "dUYIWn8p5Mdl9UPF", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858710433", "lyrics": "I opened my eyes last night\n And saw you in the low light\n Walking down by the bay\n On the shore\n Staring up at the stars\n That aren't there anymore\n \n I was feeling the night grow old\n And you were looking so cold\n So like an introvert\n I drew my over-shirt\n Around my arms and began\n To shiver violently before\n \n You happened to look\n And see the tunnels all around me\n Running into the dark\n Underground\n All the subways around\n Create a great sound\n \n To my motion fatigue\n Farewell\n With your ear to a seashell\n You can hear the waves\n In underwater caves\n As if you actually were inside a saltwater room\n \n Time together isn't ever quite enough\n When you and I are alone\n I've never felt so at home\n What will it take to make or break this hint of love?\n Only time, only time\n \n Can you believe that the crew has gone\n And they wouldn't let me sign on?\n All my islands have sunk\n In the deep, and I can hardly relax\n Or even oversleep\n \n But I feel warm with your hand in mine\n When we walk along the shoreline\n I guess we'll never know\n Why sparrows love the snow\n We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow\n \n (So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?)\n (Yeah, all the time)\n (All the time)\n \n Time together isn't ever quite enough\n When you and I are alone\n I've never felt so at home\n What will it take to make or break this hint of love?\n Only time, only time\n \n When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?\n If this is what I call home why does it feel so alone?\n So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?\n All the time, all the time\n \n Time together isn't ever quite enough\n When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?\n What will it take to make or break this hint of love?\n So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?\n \n All the time\n \n (Oh, all the time)", "comment": "This song is so beautiful, but so sad. From personal experience, I think this song is about two young people who are in a relationship..and they have been together for awhile. I think it is about how one of them is falling out of love with the other, even though he or she still loves him or her..just not romantically anymore. Even though the guy may not feel that he is in love with her anymore, he still cares deeply for her, wanting to be with her all the time. He wants to be in love with her (or vice versa) so badly, but he just can't feel it. So, they keep asking each other if they want to fall in love (maybe fall back in love). And they want to, they say the do all the time. They feel like they never get enough time together, and when they are, it feels like a safe and warm place to be. However, they question whether or not \"home\" is in the other person's arms. They have called it home for so long, that they just don't know if it really is anymore. emmzieon December 18, 2012\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "dVae4XR6Gy8dAHqR", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107859432993", "lyrics": "The piano is not firewood yet\n They try to remember but still they forget\n That the heart beats in threes\n Just like a waltz\n And nothing can stop you from dancing\n \n Rise from your cold hospital bed\n You're not dying\n Everyone knows you're going to live\n So you might as well start trying\n \n The piano is not firewood yet\n But the cold does get cold\n So it soon might be that\n I'll take it apart, call up my friends\n And we'll warm up our hands by the fire\n \n Don't look so shocked\n Don't judge so harsh\n You don't know\n You are only spying\n Everyone knows it's going to hurt\n But at least we'll get hurt trying\n \n The piano is not firewood yet\n But a heart can't be helped\n And it gathers regret\n Someday you'll wake up and feel a great pain\n And you'll miss every toy you ever owned\n \n You'll want to go back\n You'll wish you were small\n Nothing can slow the crying\n You'll take the clock off of your wall\n And you'll wish it was lying\n \n Love what you have and you'll have more love\n You're not dying\n Everyone knows you're going to love\n Though there's still no cure for crying", "comment": "I think this song is about depression/suicide, and how hard it can be to get out of. The \"piano\" could be the last reason why she would want to stay alive; it isn't firewood yet, therefore she continues to live. When she talks about taking it apart and finally burning it, she defends herself, because people who have never been depressed or suicidal often don't understand the reasons why anyone would want to kill themselves, let alone what it feels like to be in that situation. The part about missing your toys and wishing you were small again is a metaphor for remembering the times when you were truly happy, and wishing you could have those times again. I think the end of the song is the saddest, because to me it means that, even if you do eventually move past the depression, you can never truly escape it. It's such a heartbreaking song, I cry every single time I hear it. rhosymedreon June 03, 2012\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "dWoAt8vpq9BABlIH", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858634215", "lyrics": "He left no time to regret\n Kept his dick wet\n With his same old safe bet\n Me and my head high\n And my tears dry\n Get on without my guy\n \n You went back to what you knew\n So far removed\n From all that we went through\n And I tread a troubled track\n My odds are stacked\n \n I'll go back to black\n We only said goodbye with words\n I died a hundred times\n You go back to her\n \n And I go back to\n \n I go back to... us\n I love you much\n It's not enough\n You love blow and I love puff\n And life is like a pipe\n \n And I'm a tiny penny\n Rolling up the walls inside\n We only said goodbye with words\n I died a hundred times\n \n You go back to her\n And I go back to\n We only said goodbye with words\n I died a hundred times\n \n You go back to her\n And I go back to\n Black, black, black, black\n \n Black, black, black\n I go back to\n I go back to\n \n We only said goodbye with words\n I died a hundred times\n You go back to her\n And I go back to\n \n We only said goodbye with words\n I died a hundred times\n You go back to her\n And I go back to black", "comment": "i think this song is basically about a man's love for cocaine ('her')and her love for heroin ('black', as in black tar). \"And I tread a troubled track, my arms are stackedI go back to black\"i'm not sure what to make of this, but i think it's significant. her arms stacked...does this mean shooting up? stacked withtattoos to cover her track marks...?

But somehow they never got close enough to each other as they both wanted for unexplained reasons. The girl seems to go through difficulties in her life, and the guy is always there, but he needs her to tell her when because she hides her problems so well. At times, they don't speak. The guy is left wondering what happened, but it's something too deep. He leaves the issue knowing that she just might explain what happened when she's ready for him to comfort her. The guy has long realized that many do not have a shoulder to lean against, and he stays with her even if she won't speak to him, waiting for her to say when, to comfort her, to be there for her. 3xXon December 23, 2008\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "dZvLP1oOKVbj8iHm", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858694045", "lyrics": "When the world has turned\n Paralyzed and wrong\n Cold blooded claws\n Never offered anything at all\n Past the point of love\n Shattered and untied\n Waiting to pick up the pieces\n That make it all alright\n \n But pieces of what\n Pieces of what\n Pieces of what\n Doesn't matter any more\n \n Moonlight on my floor\n Shining through the roof\n They got the city surrounded\n As if I needed proof\n I forgot my fear\n Feelings on the rise\n Buried by all of the pieces\n Falling from the sky\n \n But pieces of what\n Pieces of what\n Pieces of what\n We used to call home\n Pieces of what\n We used to call home\n \n Lay my dragon's teeth\n And shallow water still\n At the Belgian gates\n I waited for my meal", "comment": "I think this song is about just being drained from any situation or relationship.

With that in mind, I would also like to say that I don't think this song is directly to a specific gender. It's one of those wonderfully ambiguous songs that can address both genders and both hetero- and homosexual couples. Also, I love the Egyptian sounding melodic line he uses. It really adds something to the song, which went very interestingly with my previous opinion that this had something to do with forbidden relationships, such as in a church or school.

But, she is a very sad girl hense, \"eyes without a face\". She used to have a soul but its almost gone now she's not mean she just fake and always sad. For example he's out of hope to tell her. But than she \"calls him on the phone to tell him she's alone\" and even though he doesnt want to go he goes anyways. At the end he says its such a, \"human waste\" I think he means she couldve been special but since so many things happened like billy said, \"its just getting worse\". So there's no way for this girl to get her feelings back shes just an empty soul. Anyways that's how i view the song please tell me if you have another opinion im very open. cyndi5360on February 16, 2006\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "eHwhyEAdXEfr93n1", "songmeanings_id": "13092", "lyrics": "Hand in glove\n The sun shines out of our behinds\n No, it's not like any other love\n This one is different because it's us\n Hand in glove\n We can go wherever we please\n And everything depends upon\n How near you stand to me\n And if the people stare\n Then the people stare\n Oh I really don't know and I really don't care\n It's not a shame, no\n \n Hand in glove\n The Good People laugh\n Yes, we may be hidden by rags\n But we've something they'll never have\n Hand in glove\n The sun shines out of our behinds\n Yes, we may be hidden by rags\n But we've something they'll never have\n And if the people stare\n Then the people stare\n Oh I really don't know and I really don't care\n \n It's not a shame, no\n \n So hand in glove, I stake my claim\n I'll fight to the last breath\n If they dare touch a hair on your head\n I'll fight to the last breath\n For the Good Life is out there somewhere\n So stay on my arms, you little charmer\n But I know my luck too well\n Yes I know my luck too well\n \n And I'll probably never see you again\n I'll probably never see you again\n I'll probably never see you again", "comment": "So I really think this song is about how he's straight and trying to have a normal relationship but people are so against it because they insist he's homosexual.

If anything it is asking God why he waited to help. I think this song is about suicide. If you pay attention to the lyrics he talks to God and a female, probably a girl he was in love with. She never returned his calls or left him message, just like God never answered his prayers. Think about the chorus. \"Lost and insecure\" \"Lying on the floor, surrounded surrounded\" (My bet is lying on the floor surrounded in blood) \"Why did you have to wait to find me\" (Because he is already dead). I personally thought of Heath Ledger when I heard this song. I do think he was truely depressed, and he was found lying on the floor dead... it's weird how it coincides. Like he could have been saved from this death if people would have found out about him earlier... but people waited til it was too late. whysoserious32on January 30, 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link5 Replies "}, {"music4all_id": "eXsa7zYqejIh22iA", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858697423", "lyrics": "Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n \n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n \n Put a smile\n Put a smile on my face\n Put a smile\n Put a smile on my face\n Put a smile\n Put a smile on my face\n Put a smile\n Put a smile on my face\n \n Put a price\n Put a price on my soul\n Put a price\n Put a price on my soul\n Put a price\n Put a price on my soul\n Put a price\n Put a price on my soul\n \n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n \n Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n \n Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n Find a cure\n Find a cure for my life\n \n Put a price\n Put a price on my soul\n Put a price\n Put a price on my soul\n \n Build a wall\n Build a fortress 'round my heart\n \n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n \n Is this fun for you?\n \n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n \n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n \n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n \n Oh my God\n Oh you think I'm in control\n Oh my God\n Oh you think it's all for fun\n \n Oh my God\n Oh my God\n Oh my God\n Oh my God\n Oh my God\n Oh my God", "comment": "I think this song is clearly about having a mental disorder. oh you think im in controland u think its all for fun. is people not understanding what shes going throughi have bipolar disorder and this is how i feel. and find a cure for my lifei think means find a cure for her insanity. idk thats what i got out of it. i dont think its being slutty or a heavy partier. the way her voice comes across in the song sounds painfull and sad. frustrated almost. idk i may be wrong. caylaiscoolon September 22, 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "ex0MYXa9HZU0Kys1", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858619998", "lyrics": "Rise\n \n Store-bought attitude and spit\n A sugar-coated piece of shit\n An instant rebel, just add greed\n Another useless commodity\n Broken glass and a broken jaw\n Lies are told in a southern drawl\n Poor-house poverty's your schtick\n The real thing would kill you quick\n \n Rise, again we will rise\n Rise, again we will rise\n \n Blood and fire used to fill the night\n Burnt and drowned by our very lives\n You missed a sinking boat by years\n Dollar signs, crocodile tears\n It's over now and long has been\n Those days are gone won't come again\n Another name crossed off the list\n The real thing would kill you quick\n \n Rise, again we will rise\n Rise, again we will rise\n \n There's nothing for you to fight against\n You're so unreal it's evident\n You'll never be one of our kind\n This ain't yours, fuck you don't try\n (This ain't yours, fuck you don't try)\n (This ain't yours, fuck you don't try)\n (This ain't yours, fuck you don't try)\n (This ain't yours, fuck you don't try)\n (This was never yours, fuck you don't try)\n \n This bridge was burnt before you could cross\n You reap the benefits of what's lost\n Go home son, hang your costume up\n A goddamn insult to the rest of us\n A thousand-yard state across the south\n A full belly and a lying mouth\n Momma's boy plays heretic\n The real thing would kill you quick\n \n Rise, again we will rise\n Rise, again we will rise\n \n There's nothing for you to fight against\n You're so unreal it's evident\n You'll never be one of our kind\n This ain't yours, fuck you don't try\n (Rise) Fuck you, don't even try\n (Rise) Fuck you, your time is nigh\n (Rise) Fuck you, I've had enough\n (Rise) Fuck you, your time is up\n (Rise) Fuck you, don't even try\n (Rise) Fuck you, your time is nigh\n (Rise) Fuck you, I've had enough\n (Rise) Fuck you, your time is up", "comment": "I think this song is to all the fake fucks who see a sell out on TV and try to be like them.

So, I'm thinking he wrote this song when they were on tour ('nothing feels like home, you're a thousand miles away'). It's pretty easy to picture the guy sitting in a hotel room reminiscing over the love of his life. No wonder they're engaged now - this song probably is what won katie back. I think this song is really easy to relate to when you get out of a deep relationship with someone and you still really want to be with them, but circumstances dictate otherwise. You think you can live without the person, but in reality you know that without em, you'll only be miserable at best. carefreedudeon August 18, 2007\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "fbuUGtFIJBT0LZvF", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858502225", "lyrics": "She seems dressed in all of me\n Stretched across my shame\n All the torment and the pain\n Leaked through and covered me\n I'd do anything to have her to myself\n Just to have her for myself\n Now I don't know what to do\n I don't know what to do\n When she makes me sad\n She is everything to me\n The unrequited dream\n A song that no one sings\n The unattainable\n she's a myth that I have to believe in\n All I need to make it real is one more reason\n I don't know what to do\n I don't know what to do\n When she makes me sad\n But I won't let this build up inside of me\n I won't let this build up inside of me\n I won't let this build up inside of me\n I won't let this build up inside of me\n I catch in my throat\n Choke\n Torn into pieces\n I won't, no\n I don't want to be this\n But I won't let this build up inside of me (won't let this build up inside of me)\n I won't let this build up inside of me (won't let this build up inside of me)\n I won't let this build up inside of me\n (won't let this build up inside of me)\n I won't let this build up inside of me\n (won't let this build up inside of me)\n (won't let this build up inside of me)\n She isn't real (won't let this build up inside of me)\n I can't make her real (won't let this build up inside of me)\n She isn't real (won't let this build up inside of me)\n I can't make her real (won't let this build up inside of me", "comment": "im amazed by all the completely different interpretations of this song. i enjoy reading them all so much, this is one of those epic songs that if one listens to makes them go out and buy the album. i think this song is about Him being in love with a girl whose his friend and who doesn't love him. all the lyrics say exactly what i think think.

Mainly because of:\"You've washed your handsYou've made that all too clearYou just keep on living this lie\"Which is what Pilot did to claim innocence of Jesus' death. The other reason why I think this is singing from Jesus' perspective is because of this line:\"You refuse to see I'm in agony\"Which I assume to mean that people turn away to avoid seeing Jesus in pain. The whole calling to \"my dear\" part throws me off though. Perhaps it's referring to Jesus calling to sinners? I'm not sure. However, that is my take. This is the kind of song that could be interpreted to be highly-pro religious or highly anti-religious. But the way the references to the Bible were used make me think that the song is highly-pro religious. I doubt WT would blatantly go against Christianity because their sales would probably go down.

I think the Sesame Street line is a reference to how, according to therapists, any problem we have in adulthood can be traced back to childhood. matthew_gentlyon April 10, 2006\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "gIREZM1BWfofY45R", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858677443", "lyrics": "Disgusted by your weakness\n You have no right to live\n To know you is to hate you\n But your life's yours to give\n \n You monkey see, you monkey do\n You're always doing what they tell you to\n You're such a puppet on a string\n You don't get it\n \n I won't bow to something\n That I've never seen\n Can't believe in something\n That doesn't believe in me\n \n I'm not blood of your blood\n I'm no son of your God\n I've no faith in your fate\n Still I find salvation\n \n You think you have the answers\n To every last detail\n In your eyes, you're the victor\n In mine, you've all but failed\n \n You monkey see, you monkey do\n You're always doing what they tell you to\n You're such a puppet on a string\n You don't get it\n \n Just monkey see and monkey do\n You're always doing what they tell you to\n You're like a puppet on a string\n You don't get it\n \n I won't bow to something\n That I've never seen\n Can't believe in something\n That doesn't believe in me\n \n I'm not blood of your blood\n I'm no son of your God\n I've no faith in your fate\n Still I find salvation\n \n Still I find salvation\n Still I find salvation.", "comment": "Alright,I think this song is about the people who blindly follow their religions. Those people that eat up everything the church has to say without a second thought. It's not necessarily about religions shoving it down peoples throats, more about the people taking the shoving with a big fucking smile. Those people so close minded when it comes to pointing out the flaws in what they believe in, that they block it out and use the opposing opinion as a Frisbee/ something to aim at when they piss.

Mark Twain once said \"Every person is a moon, with a dark side which he never shows to anybody.\" There is darkness in every person, but we spend so much time trying to deny it and fight against it that we waste our lives in the process. The darkness is part of us, so without it, we can never be whole, destined to spend our lives searching for what we are missing because we can't believe that what we are missing is that other piece of ourselves that we are so desperate to deny. I believe this song is about accepting that darkness within yourself in order to find salvation. It's about yin and yang, about finding harmony within the balance between good and evil, love and hate, light and darkness. It's about embracing the darkness within, in order to walk in the light.

Jesus is said to visit his tomb and raise him from the dead. So, generally speaking, I think this song is about recovery from ills and moving on to new beginnings. I get the impression that the subject of the story, David, has endured a fairly miserable existence, raised by \"twisted folk\" in a \"cheerless town\". He is aware that he can have a better life, however (seeing light, i.e. the moon, through the fog). A voice (perhaps a religious/spiritual presence, or maybe his subconscious) then implores him to move towards the light of that moon - towards a better life. \"Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul\" would hint at his yearning to reach that light.

It could just be referring to a guy talking about the girl he is in love with and he feels his main purpose for being put on this earth was to be with her. katiezon January 05, 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "gxVc3JUykVtpBR7n", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858819215", "lyrics": "I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower\n That you made with plastic power\n Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away\n \n When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep\n Drive on engines till they weep\n With future pixels in factories far away\n \n So call the mainland from the beach\n All parties now washed up in bleach\n The waves are rising for this time of year\n And nobody knows what to do with the heat\n Under sunshine pylons we'll meet\n While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky\n \n I got a feeling now my heart is frozen\n All the verses and the corrosion\n \n Have been after native in my soul\n I prayed on the unmovable\n Yeah, clinging to the atoms of rock\n Seasons, the adjustments\n Times have changed\n I can't see now, she said \"taxi\"\n Now that light is so I can take\n This storm bring strange loyalties and skies\n I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower\n \n That you made with plastic power\n Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away\n Here we go again\n That's electric\n That's electric\n Helicopters fly over the beach\n Same time every day, same routine\n \n A clear target in the summer when skies are blue\n Its part of the noise when winter comes\n It reverberates in my lungs\n Nature's corrupted in factories far away\n Here we go again\n That's electric\n Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky\n That's electric\n \n With future pixels in factories far away\n Here we go again\n That's electric\n Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky\n That's electric\n With future pixels in factories far away\n Here we go again", "comment": "\"Nature's corruptedIn factories far away\"\"That's Electric\"I think this song is simply about what the cost of electricity (a.k.a.) the cost of the futuristic technology and the comfort we in 1st world nations live in. \"Nature is corrupted...\" \"yeah, but in factories far away.\" A strong connection to the phrase \"out of sight out of mind.\" People suffer from extreme poverty all over the world, but we don't know them and cannot relate to them.

Nelly has the most amazing way of making her lyrics sound so real. This song is about taking life for granted. Knowing that there are good things in your life and rushing throught too fast to see them. When she talks about dogs barking at the moon she means werewolfs barking at full moon their time coming to an end. Meaning that they are in a rush to get back to what they once was. Am I making any sense haha? Its basically saying that everything good in our lives is being missed because we are all daydreaming for a better one. Then those things will come to an end. It uses metaphors such like flames to dust meaning someones body being cremated or something being burned, something good and then being turned into dust. It also so says lovers to friends. Being lovers is so good but it always results in going back to being friends and so it has come to an end.

Of course we all know that Eminem's next best talent is stirring up controversy. If you listen to the songs on The Marshall Mathers LP, there are many reoccurrences of a message that says to his fans that a lot of the things he says should not be taken seriously, and that he doesn't really mean what he means. I think this song is that same warning, except he's trying to use an example of what would happen if you take him too seriously. Stan is writing to Eminem about how he takes everything that Eminem says seriously, and Eminem writes back saying that Stan doesn't really understand him and that Stan should seek some help. Finally, we know what happened to Stan. I think the point of the song was to send out a message to his fans to not take everything he says seriously. dingeron June 22, 2003\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "hFNplnKfNXorAgNV", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858485027", "lyrics": "There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me\n Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy\n Too many times that I've held on what I needed to push away\n Afraid to say what was on my mind afraid to say what I need to say\n \n Too many things that you said about me when I'm not around\n You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down\n But I've had too many standoffs with you it's about\n As much as I can stand so I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine\n \n (One minute you're on top)\n Next you're not watch you drop\n (Making your heart stop)\n Just before you hit the floor\n (One minute you're on top)\n Next you're not missed a shot\n (Making you're heart stop)\n You think you've won and then it's all gone\n \n So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies\n So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside\n So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long\n All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on\n \n There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line\n What goes up will surely fall and I'm counting down the time\n 'Cause I've had so many standoffs with you it's about\n As much as I can stand so I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine\n \n (One minute you're on top)\n Next you're not watch you drop\n (Making your heart stop)\n Just before you hit the floor\n (One minute you're on top)\n Next you're not missed a shot\n (Making you're heart stop)\n You think you've won and then it's all gone\n \n And then it's all gone\n And then it's all gone\n And then it's all gone\n Now it's all gone\n \n I know I'll never trust a single thing you say\n You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway\n And all the lies have got you floating up above us all\n But what goes up has got to fall\n \n (One minute you're on top)\n Next you're not watch you drop\n (Making your heart stop)\n Just before you hit the floor\n (One minute you're on top)\n Next you're not missed a shot\n (Making you're heart stop)\n You think you've won and then it's all gone\n \n And then it's all gone\n And then it's all gone\n And then it's all gone\n Now it's all gone", "comment": "i think this song is awesome and its interpreted differently by different people so maybe they (linkin park) made it one of those songs that was meant to be taken differently and fit different people? but anyway heres my interpretation of it. its about someone who was being nice to someone because they felt sorry for them, but that person thought because everyone was being nice to him he was all that, and started being a jerk to everyone, and everything was going to his head, then he realized no one likes him, and thats when he falls. pezzbton November 17, 2012\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "hRJyS2iQy3oE173z", "songmeanings_id": "45203", "lyrics": "I'm a fleabit peanut monkey\n All my friends are junkies\n That's not really true\n \n I'm a cold Italian pizza\n I could use a lemon squeezer\n What you do?\n \n But I've been bit and I've been tossed around\n By every she-rat in this town\n Have you, babe?\n \n Well, I am just a monkey man\n I'm glad you are a monkey woman too\n \n I was bitten by a boar\n I was gouged and I was gored\n But I pulled on through\n \n Yes, I'm a sack of broken eggs\n I always have an unmade bed\n Don't you?\n \n Well, I hope we're not too messianic\n Or a trifle too satanic\n We love to play the blues\n \n Well I am just a monkey man\n I'm glad you are a monkey, monkey woman too, babe\n \n I'm a monkey\n I'm a monkey\n I'm a monkey man\n I'm a monkey man\n I'm a monkey...", "comment": "I think this song is Mick and the Stones getting in touch with their primitive roots.

When Cobain says \"He said I was his friend, Which came as some surprise, I spoke into his eyes, I thought you died alone, A long long time ago\" he sounds slightly angry. When he meets him he doesn't expect the man who wronged him to say he was his friend, and he immediately accuses him of having no friends because he sold the world.

I think this song is about the war and how we attack everyone that even \"hints\" that they have something thtreatning. \"we dream of the day we attack\" means we are basically just planning wars. Somehow some of the rednecks of this country feel that there is sincerity and security in \"steel machines\" like guns, bombs, tanks....etc. But in reality, its all bullshit. We are just digging ourselves into a hole and the reality of \"Attack\" is that villages are destroyed, people are killed, and lands are polluted. And after we pillage their lands, we hang our flags to prove that we have been their and claim it as ours.

Just read the lyrics, and you'll find it's pretty much about the guy being thankful for the angel that watched over him. He refers to her merely as 'she'. And also, one of you guys said that Robbie Williams didn't really write this song? That you actually did, and you sold it to him? Well it seems like you're not much upset by it.

Because of her instability, she's seen as easy to men, but in reality she's just too tired to stop something from happening. She's looking for comfort in any form, and has lost the ability to pick herself up. Whoever is singing to song and telling her story clearly cares about her and sees her in a different light than the rest of the world, knows that she can be, or is, better than the standards she has set for herself. He wants to save her. I agree with the people who think it could be about a prostitute as well, but I like to think of \"The Belle of the Boulevard\" more as a lady who has fallen from grace, and is just stuck in a rut of poor judgement and sketchy situations.

I think the fat boy comments are not made with the assumption stated ('I was going to say that calling him a \"fat boy\" is a stereotype but as I think about it, I guess if you were rich, you would have more to eat. It's still a stereotype, but more like a \"semi-stereotype\"') however, as another word for capitalist pig. Pig = Fat. This is all my opinion, I could very well be wrong.

There's a wall between them and they feel the other person isn't really trying and they can't do it anymore. (Sorry I couldn't get to you). It's hard to do because they love this person with all their heart, but they're exhausted from doing everything and getting nothing in return. Even though it hurts, they have to walk away. And now they're wondering if the other person even cares, if he/she ever really loved them. They're saying Say Something because they have to leave but feels like the other person hasn't even noticed. It hurts that after all that effort, after finally giving up (I'm giving up on you), that person doesn't give a damn, and the silence is killing them.

Manson has done alot of changing through out the years and not everyone has liked it. if you do recall, every single manson cd has been distinctly different. and this is about what i expect his new sound would be like, industrial with depressing lyrics and impressive guitar lines. notice its not a complete turn around from his later work, but it is changing, that why i like manson so much, he doesnt repeat himself musically, theres much diversity in his sound from the screaming industrial metal of antichrist superstar to the funky glam rock of mechanical animals to the rave indusrial \"hate-pop\" of golden age of grotesque. he's almost always kept an industrial background, but expressed it in different ways. i think this song is about his divorce and reletionship with the 19 year old actress that he cheated on dita with. you fill in the blanks.

She's asking him to tell her side of the story, and be honest about the fact that he cheated instead of blaming her (i.e. \"tell them I was happy\"). I wish this song had come out a few years ago, because it mirrors the situation I was in with my boyfriend at the time. He cheated on me, and I was completely blindsided by it. I thought we were happy, but apparently he didn't feel the same. *Sigh*. At the very least I am grateful to Shontelle for putting the heartbreak into words. goddesscarolineon October 21, 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "kVJrgk5VyxX9Nprz", "songmeanings_id": "61596", "lyrics": "Who would be a poor man\n A beggar man, a thief\n If he had a rich man in his hand?\n And who would steal the candy\n From a laughing baby's mouth\n If he could take it from the money man?\n \n Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again\n She signs no contract\n But she always plays the game\n She dines in Hampstead village\n On expense accounted gruel\n And the jack-knife barber drops her off at school\n \n Hey, laughing in the playground\n Gets no kicks from little boys\n Would rather make it with a letching gray, yeah\n Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung\n Who watches through the railings as they play\n \n Hey, cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along\n She's a poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song\n She's a rich man stealer but her favour's good and strong\n She's the Robin Hood of Highgate\n Helps the poor man get along, hey\n \n Laughing in the playground\n Gets no kicks from little boys\n Would rather make it with a letching gray, yeah\n Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung\n Who watches through the railings as they play\n \n Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again\n She signs no contract\n But she always plays the game\n She dines in Hampstead village\n On expense accounted gruel\n And the jack-knife barber drops her off at school\n \n Hey, cross-eyed Mary, oh baby, oh, cross-eyed Mary", "comment": "I agree to the meaning, GAnthony.

All human beings seem to cause is pain, whether it be to loved ones, strangers or the environment.

All we ever seem to be doing is making mistakes and apologising for them. The background lyrics seem to me to be, 'Hey, hey, woman, it's all right.' Could this be an address to Mother Nature, or is it just another story that is mirrored throughout every human life, another heartbroken, another spurt of pain released from our souls. The human race is slowly going crazy - we are destroying ourselves and our planet...tell the truth Mother Nature...You never wanted Us...we are the hell-fire that is burning you softly. bluephoenix36on July 09, 2005\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "kx5t5aYAp1xKt417", "songmeanings_id": "12445", "lyrics": "What's the matter Mary Jane, had a hard day?\n As you place the: \"Don't Disturb\" sign on the door\n You lost your place in line again, what a pity\n You never seem to want to dance anymore\n \n It's a long way down\n On this roller-coaster\n The last chance streetcar\n Went off the track\n And you're on it\n \n I hear you're counting sheep again Mary Jane\n What's the point of tryin' to dream anymore?\n I hear you're losing weight again Mary Jane\n Do you ever wonder who you're losing it for?\n \n Well it's full speed baby\n In the wrong direction\n There's a few more bruises\n If that's the way\n You insist on heading\n \n Please be honest Mary Jane\n Are you happy?\n Please don't censor your tears\n \n You're the sweet crusader\n And you're on your way\n You're the last great innocent\n And that's why I love you\n \n So take this moment Mary Jane and be selfish\n Worry not about the cars that go by\n 'Cause all that matters Mary Jane is your freedom\n So keep warm my dear, keep dry\n \n Tell me\n Tell me\n What's the matter Mary Jane?\n Tell me\n Tell me\n Please be honest Mary Jane\n Tell me\n Ooh-ah\n Ooh", "comment": "at first this song was my least favourite song on jagged little pill but once i fully grasped this song, i realised how beautiful it is. i think this song is about anybody feeling unworthy, with self-image problems and going through a difficult time. but this song and many other songs can mean whatever to the listener. alanis write something like, \"may your own unique interpretations of these songs hold you with tenderness,\" in the flavors of entanglement thank you notes. sopurejunkieon January 22, 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "kzX18LX1OeiwPq2T", "songmeanings_id": "61596", "lyrics": "Who would be a poor man\n A beggar man, a thief\n If he had a rich man in his hand?\n And who would steal the candy\n From a laughing baby's mouth\n If he could take it from the money man?\n \n Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again\n She signs no contract\n But she always plays the game\n She dines in Hampstead village\n On expense accounted gruel\n And the jack-knife barber drops her off at school\n \n Hey, laughing in the playground\n Gets no kicks from little boys\n Would rather make it with a letching gray, yeah\n Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung\n Who watches through the railings as they play\n \n Hey, cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along\n She's a poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song\n She's a rich man stealer but her favour's good and strong\n She's the Robin Hood of Highgate\n Helps the poor man get along, hey\n \n Laughing in the playground\n Gets no kicks from little boys\n Would rather make it with a letching gray, yeah\n Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung\n Who watches through the railings as they play\n \n Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again\n She signs no contract\n But she always plays the game\n She dines in Hampstead village\n On expense accounted gruel\n And the jack-knife barber drops her off at school\n \n Hey, cross-eyed Mary, oh baby, oh, cross-eyed Mary", "comment": "I agree to the meaning, GAnthony.

Being that person who is there for them when all of their other \"friends\" have abandoned them, and being the person they know will be behind them to pick them up when they fall. h3xc45t3ron August 14, 2008\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "lHLcR3rN2klacdnW", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107859460027", "lyrics": "It's our party, we can do what we want\n It's our party, we can say what we want\n It's our party, we can love who we want\n We can kiss who we want\n We can screw who we want\n It's our party, we can do what we want\n It's our party, we can say what we want\n It's our party, we can love who we want\n We can kiss who we want\n We can screw who we want\n \n Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere\n Hands in the air like we don't care\n 'Cause we came to have so much fun now\n Bet somebody here might get some now\n If you're not ready to go home\n Can I get a \"hell no\"?\n 'Cause we gonna go all night\n 'Till we see the sunlight, alright (Hey, hey, hey)\n \n So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party\n Dancing with Molly\n Doing whatever we want\n This is our house\n This is our rules\n \n And we can't stop\n And we won't stop\n Can't you see it's we who own the night?\n Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?\n And we can't stop\n And we won't stop\n We run things, things don't run we\n Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah, yeah\n \n It's our party, we can do what we want\n It's our party, we can say what we want\n It's our party, we can love who we want\n We can kiss who we want\n We can screw who we want\n \n To my homegirls here with the big butt\n Shaking it like we at a strip club\n Remember only God can judge ya\n Forget the haters, 'cause somebody loves ya\n And everyone in line in the bathroom\n Tryna get a line in the bathroom\n We all so turned up here\n Getting turned up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n \n So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party\n Dancing with Molly\n Doing whatever we want\n This is our house\n This is our rules\n \n And we can't stop\n And we won't stop\n Can't you see it's we who own the night?\n Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?\n And we can't stop\n And we won't stop\n We run things, things don't run we\n Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah, yeah\n \n It's our party, we can do what we want\n It's our party, we can say what we want\n It's our party, we can love who we want\n We can kiss who we want\n We can screw who we want\n \n It's our party, we can do what we want to\n It's our house, we can love who we want to\n It's our song, we can sing if we want to\n It's my mouth, I can say what I want to\n Say, \"Yeah yeah yeah ehh\"\n \n And we can't stop (Yeah)\n And we won't stop (Oh)\n Can't you see it's we who own the night?\n Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?\n And we can't stop\n And we won't stop\n We run things, things don't run we\n Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah, yeah\n Yeah, yeah\n Eeh", "comment": "People can hate on this song all they want but it's still on replay on most young adults playlists.

Hawkins and the Westroads Mall shooting. After writing a suicide note and stealing his stepfather's gun, he fired over thirty rounds shooting 12 people and himself. Only eight were killed, I think. The others were injured. Some of the lines in the song don't make sense to me though. Like, \"six shooter gun\". The gun Hawkins used was a semi-automatic rifle. The \"fun stuff\" that was found in his dad's(or stepdad's) closet I think refers to the Diazepam(perhaps induced his rage?) that was found in his system. I may be wrong, but I honestly believe this is what it is about. Though through some other comments I saw, people mentioned other kids named Robert that had something to do with a shooting? If anyone has any information on those kids, I'd appreciate it if someone would contact me.

He says that he's depressed about the whole situation and wants to leave the place but its pointless cause he'll still be thinking about her. He mentions how he thinks she is dealing with the same thing and how it aint right that they should both be going through this personal pain and anguish. This is where the song shows its full meaning...the end part, i believe he is saying that after trying to hook up with this girl again, he realizes that he was only drunk or high and she was really only playing with him when he thought something meaningful was between them. So now he's left looking like the fool for going after her. He gambles on calling her, but she totally blows him off and he falls flat on his face and into the fire.

It isn't saying to really have sympathy for him, it is saying that maybe we should stop blaming him for all bad things, and maybe start taking a look at ourselvesserg340on December 29, 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link5 Replies "}, {"music4all_id": "llNAVzDer0sLRwfF", "songmeanings_id": "6302", "lyrics": "Please allow me to introduce myself\n I'm a man of wealth and taste\n I've been around for a long, long year\n Stole many a man's soul and fate\n I was 'round when Jesus Christ\n Had his moments of doubt and pain\n Made damn sure that Pilate\n Washed his hands and sealed his fate\n \n Pleased to meet you\n Hope you guess my name, oh yeah\n But what's puzzling you\n Is the nature of my game\n \n I stuck around St. Petersburg\n When I saw it was a time for a change\n Killed the Czar and his ministers\n Anastasia screamed in vain\n I rode a tank\n Held a General's rank\n When the Blitzkrieg raged\n And the bodies stank\n \n Pleased to meet you\n Hope you guess my name, oh yeah\n What's puzzling you\n Is the nature of my game, oh yeah\n \n I watched the glee\n While your kings and queens\n Fought for ten decades\n For the Gods they made\n \n I shouted out\n \"Who killed the Kennedys?\"\n Well after all\n It was you and me\n \n Let me please introduce myself\n I'm a man of wealth and taste\n And I laid traps for troubadours\n Who get killed before they reached Bombay\n \n Pleased to meet you\n Hope you guess my name, oh yeah\n But what's puzzling you\n Is the nature of my game, oh yeah\n \n Pleased to meet you\n Hope you guess my name, oh yeah\n But what's confusing you\n Is just the nature of my game, ooh yeah\n \n Just as every cop is a criminal\n And all the sinners saints\n As heads is tails just call me Lucifer\n I'm in need of some restraint\n \n So if you meet me, have some courtesy\n Have some sympathy and some taste\n Use all your well learned politics\n Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mmm yeah\n \n Pleased to meet you\n Hope you guess my name, mmm yeah\n But what's puzzling you\n Is the nature of my game, get down\n Woo hoo, ah yeah, get on down, oh yeah\n \n Tell me, baby, what's my name?\n Tell me, honey, baby guess my name\n Tell me, baby, what's my name?\n I'll ya one time you're to blame\n \n What's my name?\n Tell me, baby, what's my name?\n Tell me, sweetie, what's my name?", "comment": "I dont think this song is in the Devil's POV, and I dont think it is anything to do with God, a lot of people here are very angry and want to blame everything on god, I'm not religious so I think it is pitiful when people lump theirs/humanity's problems on God. I think the song is another hidden message song, the song could very well be talking about the group of families that have been around for centuries and had a hand in these historic events and influence on society behind the scenes. Rothschilds, Rockerfellers, FreeMasons. Federal Reseve Bank. You know what I'm referring to. Do research it, it is plain and clear. The line in the song that struck me was the one about killing the Kennedy Brothers.

They know that by leaving the past behind they can never get it back, but any moment is better than the one that person is in, because they don't have anything.

Let me be miserable and move on.\" What's wrong with being sad? We all are, at some point, and usually, if you can just be left alone with it, without being subjegated, without the constant, \"are you okays? \", you'll feel better rather quickly. But if anybody gets any sort of inkling that you're upset over anything at all, even if it's nothing, it's just constant pestering. I can relate to this, honestly. I hate that question, \"are you okay?\" It makes it so that I cannot simply ignore the problem, or it brings it up when I'm starting to get over it. \"are you okay?\" What's wrong with being sad?

The end has to be one of the most beautiful moments on the new album...

So he's being harsh, pushing her away, telling her to move on, telling her he's gonna move on--tough love--it's all for her sake, to keep her safe. It's very tragic. They both lose.

I have close family that believes that there is no such thing as \"Christian rock\" music. I personally don't believe that God \"hates\" certain genres of music. Sure, hard rock music started out Satanic, but that doesn't mean that you can't NOT have worship with drums in it.

Anyway, here is what I think about the song. Obviously, in the literal sense this song is about the movie the band members wrote. I think that the song is rather metaphorical as well. Since Walcott is on a mission to save Cape Cod, I'd say most of the lyrics are just excuses for why he should get \"out of Cape Cod tonight.\" It almost seems like the song is sung from the perspective of the voice inside Walcott's head that is telling him to leave. The important part about this is that he has the responsibility to save Cape Cod so he can't. Therefore, I think this song is about responsibilities, the desire to run away from them, and the struggle to persevere.

As for the meaning: I disagree with it being about someone breaking up with you and finding out that they never loved you because of two lyrics:\"I see the angels, I'll lead them to your door, there's no escape now, no mercy no more\": If this song was about being dumped, then this part would mean getting together all of the other girls that the guy betrayed to take revenge on him, which sounds like something out of some bad chick flick. \"You could have chosen a different path in life\" Betraying girls isn't really a major \"path\" someone can take. I think this song is about a girl who is in love with someone who has gained her trust, but the person, who is a serial killer, kills her and she finds out that he never loved her. So, she is seeking revenge on him with the other people that he killed.

Anyway, I think this song is about a man trying to find his way in the world and has come to a part in his life where he's always depressed and doesn't know why, it feels like forgetting the words to your favorite song. He tries to drown out the sorrows with noise and, later, mischief. I have two alternate views on the ending, either nothing is resolved and it is just a sad tale of someone lost in a depression, or the man eventually realizes that what he really just needs is just a friend who can understand him.

Maybe after losing a significant other? Forgetting the song could be a metaphor for losing memories of this person, such as their voice or how they looked. It used to come so easily to you to remember them, but now that they're gone it's harder to remember the little things. I also think that the headphones line could represent a song that used to be special to this person and their other. Remembering better times. And an interpretation of the \"stealing\" line that I haven't heard before.. Suicide? Stealing one's own life. The speaker is saying they are thinking about taking their own life, and open a window to kind of get a better grip on reality. I know that sometimes the feel of cold air can remind you that you actually are alive. And hearing the boy start to cry.. I think this whole stanza is about the person reminding themself that life goes on. lexertonon January 17, 2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "oYQ1IYmDvICWXyRF", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858864952", "lyrics": "You got away, got away, got away from me\n Now get away, get away, get away from me\n \n I couldn't grow just living in the shadow\n Where do you go when no one's following you?\n You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue\n \n Shall I go on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on again?\n \n Rosemary you're part of me\n You know you are, you are, you are\n Rosemary you're part of me\n You know you are, you are, you are\n Rosemary please pardon me\n Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie\n Youth ain't change the way you die\n \n Dear Rosemary\n Dear Rosemary\n \n You got away, got away, got away with things\n You got away, got away, got away with things\n \n False starts, young hearts get shattered\n Pick up the pieces coming down around you\n You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue\n \n Can I go on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on again?\n \n Rosemary you're part of me\n You know you are you are you are\n Rosemary you're part of me\n You know you are you are you are\n Rosemary you're part of me\n \n Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie\n Youth ain't change the way you die\n \n This was no ordinary life\n (This was no ordinary life)\n This was no ordinary life\n (This was no ordinary life)\n \n I'm here from now on\n But once I'm gone\n I'm gone\n \n Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie\n Youth ain't change the way you die\n \n Dear Rosemary\n (Dear Rosemary)\n You're part of me\n (You're part of me)\n Dear Rosemary\n (Dear Rosemary)\n Please pardon me (Please pardon me)\n You got away got away got away from me\n Now get away get away get away from me", "comment": "@splayfee, I was thinking it was \"knife\" instead of \"night\". About the whole connection to Kurt Cobain's death and the lawyer, I don't really think it is about that really. If you try hard enough you can make any song sound like it's about anything. I think this song is about a relationship as are so many Foo Fighter songs. It's a fictional story about a man who apparently is about to murder his wife. There are a few clues like the first two lines \"Now get away, get away, get away from me.\" \"Youth ain't gonna change the way you die.\" This line is another clue. It isn't until the line I mentioned earlier that it is revealed that it is about murder. I think when he says it isn't an ordinary knife he means it is not being used for traditional purposes with the part about his wife not being ordinary being a dig on her. Of course, this is my interpretation and it would be sick as hell if it is Dave's interpretation as well.

That was my reaction when I listened to this song back in the day. Listening to it now, though, I think it's just making fun of the concept of being the \"nice guy\" in general. I feel like the \"finish last\" part is referencing how so many \"heroes\" end up getting fucked over in reality. A lot of the other lines in the song seem like obvious references to the traditional definition of good guys and bad guys in comic books, and I think the rest of it is just making fun of how \"good guys\" work. They side step shame they've got with convenient amnesia, they make promises they can't keep, their highs are great, but their low points are terrible and dramatic, they brown nose a lot, and they can think incredibly highly of themselves on the inside.

Major lifestyle changes (moving, new job, etc) often create new situations that a relationship may or may not recover from.

Even though the couple loves each other they know that if they stay together, they won't be able to pursue what they truly love. I also think the chorus documents the last moment of the relationship where the couple embrace for the final time before no longer being together.

However, when she was younger she did an erotic shoot which has come back to haunt her. It is told from the point of view of the person who directed the erotic \"European\" film. In the first verse he sees her picture with her name above it, probably a movie poster. He irconically says it's her big debut because he knows that she did a less well known film in her past. And he knows that the audience will love her smile for the camera because he's seen it and loves it. The second verse, he finds the old pictures he had taken of the girl which he's kept with their correspondence. In the chorus we learn that the actress's name is Peg and that her old photoshoot will come back to embarrass her. richard101on July 09, 2015\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "pTbOFqouJA5RGeSV", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858519237", "lyrics": "It's so cold in this house\n Open mouth swallowing us\n The children staying home from school\n Will not stop crying\n \n And I know that you're busy too\n I know that you care\n You got your finger on the pulse\n You got your eyes everywhere\n And it hurts all the time when you don't return my calls\n And you haven't got the time to remember how it was\n It's so cold in this house\n It's so cold in this house\n \n I can't eat, I can't sleep\n I can't sleep, I can't dream\n An aversion to light\n Got a fear of the ocean\n \n Like drinking poison, like eating glass\n Like drinking poison, like eating glass\n Like drinking poison, like eating glass\n Like drinking poison, like eating glass\n Like drinking poison, like eating\n \n It's so cold in this house\n It's so cold in this house\n It's so cold in this house\n It's so cold in this bed\n \n Like drinking poison, like eating glass\n Like drinking poison, like eating glass\n Like drinking poison, like eating glass\n Like drinking poison, like eating glass\n Like drinking poison, like eating\n \n Come and show me how it was\n \n We've got crosses on our eyes\n Been walking into the walls again\n We've got crosses on our eyes\n Been walking into the furniture\n We've got crosses on our eyes\n For richer, for poorer, for better, for worse\n We've got crosses on our eyes\n We've been walking into the furniture", "comment": "i think this song is about divorce. \\\"it\\'s so cold in this house\\\" refers to him living alone without his wife. the kids are home from school and won\\'t stop crying. their mother is not around to take care of them. he is lonely and tries to call but she never calls back. the line \\\"and you haven\\'t got time to remember how it was\\\" shows that he wants to reconcile and go back to the old happy days of marraige, but she won\\'t. \\\"come and show me how it was\\\" is him pleading for her to come back. the chorus at the end when he says the line \\\"for richer for poorer for better for worse\\\" is an obvious reference to wedding vows. icy40ozon April 23, 2005\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link2 Replies "}, {"music4all_id": "pZtkM5PcDvXLMrWJ", "songmeanings_id": "16542", "lyrics": "Welcome to your life\n There's no turning back\n Even while we sleep\n We will find you\n \n Acting on your best behaviour\n Turn your back on Mother Nature\n Everybody wants to rule the world\n \n It's my own design\n It's my own remorse\n Help me to decide\n Help me make the most\n \n Of freedom and of pleasure\n Nothing ever lasts forever\n Everybody wants to rule the world\n \n There's a room where the light won't find you\n Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down\n When they do I'll be right behind you\n \n So glad we've almost made it\n So sad they had to fade it\n Everybody wants to rule the world\n \n I can't stand this indecision\n Married with a lack of vision\n Everybody wants to rule the world\n \n Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it\n One headline, why believe it?\n Everybody wants to rule the world\n \n All for freedom and for pleasure\n Nothing ever lasts forever\n Everybody wants to rule the world", "comment": "I think this song is about every single one of us.

The singer is saying that this isn't all it's cracked up to be, that there are no happy endings. The line, \"Who am I to disagree\" is almost ironic. If this is what sweet dreams are made of, why am I complaining? Then the next few lines, talking about being used and abused, clearly refer to people who only want to use you in a relationship (i.e. a guy dating a girl only to get into her pants, or a gold digger marrying a rich man just to get money) or people who experience domestic violence in their relationships. darthxraneon April 06, 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "qEwLVXUeIUlKkLwQ", "songmeanings_id": "2875", "lyrics": "You say the hill's too steep to climb,\n chiding\n You say you'd like to see me try,\n climbing\n You pick the place and I'll choose the time\n And I'll climb the hill in my own way\n Just wait a while for the right day\n And as I rise above the tree-line and the clouds\n I look down hear the sounds of the things you said today\n \n Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd,\n smiling\n Merciless the magistrate turns round,\n frowning\n And who's the fool who wears the crown\n No doubt in your own way\n And every day is the right day\n And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow\n You look down hear the sound of the faces in the crowd", "comment": "Very underrated songI think its just about, well, being fearless. doing what you want without worry. i think this song is pretty literal as far as Pink Floyd goes. someone is reprimanding someone else for doing a task that seems too hard. they would \"like to see them try\" in the sarcastic sense. the other person responds saying that theyll do, just name when and wait for the right day. then, when the time comes, they accomplish the task and look back on all those who said they couldn't do it. next, someone deemed an idiot faces a large crowd, without fear. some high power is displeased, probably because they wanted the idiot to fail. really, the powerful figure is the fool. do whatever works best for you and you can accomplish anything, and everyday is the right day to do it (callback to the first stanza.) all you have to do is rise above the fear of doing it. when you look back, you will see that most people were rooting for you the whole way (fade to a cheering crowd)creamboyon May 21, 2017\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "qEzcusnuUS4AYoQI", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858626217", "lyrics": "I could go back to every laugh\n But I don't wanna go there anymore\n And I know all the steps up to your door\n But I don't wanna go there anymore\n \n Talk to the wind\n Talk to the sky\n Talk to the man with the reasons why\n And let me know what you find\n \n I'll leave my window open\n 'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name\n Just know I'm right here hopin'\n That you'll come in with the rain\n \n I could stand up and sing you a song\n But I don't wanna have to go that far\n And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart\n And you don't even know where I start\n \n Talk to yourself\n Talk to the tears\n Talk to the man who put you here\n And don't wait for the sky to clear\n \n I'll leave my window open\n 'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name\n Just know I'm right here hopin'\n That you'll come in with the rain\n \n I've watched you so long, screamed your name\n I don't know what else I can say\n \n And I'll leave my window open\n 'Cause I'm too tired tonight for all these games\n Just know I'm right here hopin'\n That you'll come in with the rain\n \n I could go back to every laugh\n But I don't wanna go there anymore", "comment": "I think this song is about a girl who holds deep affections for a boy very much, but the boy doesn't feel the same way about her. She tries to do everything to try to please him, to try and get him to feel the same way. But the boy isn't innocent at all. The girl likes him so much that she finds out all the things he likes and tries to please him, hence, \"steps to your door\". HE knows exactly how she feels for him, and yet, he plays with her, and gives her ideas that they could truly be together. So as he leads her on, she falls more and more in love with him, but when she realises what he was doing all along, she becomes miserable. It could have gone two ways, either she says goodbye to him, or he leaves. Either way, the result becomes that she's not ready to let go, even thought she knows hes no good for her. So she keeps hoping that one day he'd be hers hence \"come in with the rain\".

It's about an honest person who is very sincere, and beleives that telling the truth is the right thing to do, IN ANY SITUATION. However, this ideal brings troubles to this person, at times... It is possible that Martin wrote this song about Dave Gahan, which is known for his (over-) sincerity, mostly in public interview. Something that the other band members (including Martin) didn't like at times... So, what's the message? To be a liar? no...

Didn't know that five years later this would become the song I would associate with breaking up with the person I took to the concert. In the concert he also sang a song titled Beautiful. When he introduced it he said that a major cosmetic firm had offered him a very large sum of money and royalties to base a fragrance line around it. Turned them down as he wanted listeners to associate it with a special person and a time in their life and not a product.

A guy who was dating a girl and then broke up with her for one reason or another. But once he had, he didn't know why. This guy keeps on chasing the girl once he sees his mistake, then once they are together again or she seems to forgive him, he doesn't see why he should be with her anymore. Then again when they arn't together, he dosn't understand why he left her again. So the circle goes on. I think this song isn't so much about that guy, but is the guy singing. Giving the sway from being in love, to leaving her. But no matter which it is, he sees he is doing her no good. Basically he knows he is using her as 'a simple prop to occupy my time'. Then. She doesn't want him anymore. And he realises he loves her so much, he will leave her alone.

A lot of people listen to Nirvana purely because they like their, hard rock, alternative, grungy sound. The people that don't listen to the lyrics sing along like zombies without knowing the meaning (just because it sounds good ). I believe that Kurt noticed this and it annoyed him. He would see meat headed, bigot like men, singing along to his songs (many of which had feminist themes), He wouldn't want these people as a part of his fan base. Inevitably these people would sing along to the song, and it was kind of a haha jokes on you, for Kurt. So in a way these people are insulting themselves without ever realizing it.

Every song has a meaning&every meaning is different to everyone. vandalizedon May 10, 2002\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link2 Replies "}, {"music4all_id": "rbVSL7S5QU05Wsby", "songmeanings_id": "15729", "lyrics": "Rape me\n Rape me, my friend\n Rape me\n Rape me, again\n \n I'm not the only one\n I'm not the only one\n I'm not the only one\n I'm not the only one\n \n Hate me\n Do it and do it again\n Waste me\n Rape me, my friend\n \n I'm not the only one\n I'm not the only one\n I'm not the only one\n I'm not the only one\n \n My favorite inside source\n I'll kiss your open sores\n Appreciate your concern\n You're gonna stink and burn\n \n Rape me\n Rape me, my friend\n Rape me\n Rape me, again\n \n I'm not the only one\n I'm not the only one\n I'm not the only one\n I'm not the only one\n \n Rape me!\n Rape me!\n Rape me!\n Rape me!\n Rape me!\n Rape me!\n Rape me!\n Rape me!\n Rape me!", "comment": "To be honest...I think this song is about his heroin addiction...I believe he wrote it as the narrator or the person talking being the heroin addiction... waste me...the mind of the addict crying for the drug... taste me the drug crying out to the addicts mind...Youll always stink and burn at the end being the fact that once a junkie always..not that i would know anything about it.

He never works on what he needs to do, only his own work, and when he fails, he should at least fail at doing something worth it, like helping the company, and eventually all the company hate him and blame all mistakes on him. When he complains, they say 'Take one for the team'. He's just a 'cog in the machine' and nothing special.

Pete's always had a very strong belief in the ideal of leading the good ship Albion (Britain) to the utopia of Arcadia (paradise). They're both very, very old Celtic ideas that predate Christianity in Britain (albion is the oldest known term for Britain), and so they kind of represent that kind of ancient paradise based in nature that the Celts believed in. Hence namechecking Bodicea- what they're singing about is exactly what she was fighting for. Of course, she lost and so will they- and that's why the Arcadian dream has fallen through. But the idea of the Albion sailing on course is really suggesting that it's an inevitable journey, and in a metaphorical way the Libertines will bring it about.

Second, I pretty much agree with what Lightning.J said.

out. they're either \"oooh that's so sexy!\" or \"it's a LOVE song!\" i hate the thought of sex being only sex, but i also hate the idea of perfect love. because, in my opinion, neither exsists. this reminds me more of what sex should be like: slightly animalistic, but beautiful nontheless. it reminds me of the way the human body moves when having sex, alsmost like a primitive dance. it should be with someone you are in love with, yes, but also with someone you are in lust with. the drumming in the song just adds to the rythmicness of it all. i think this song is also about trying to use

Consider it. \"You're all by yourself, but you're not alone\" sounds like someone hears something in their head. Nobody is around, but someone is there. Driven by hate and consumed by fear is how mentally ill people feel. They are angry that they are sick, but they are afraid of what could happen. It is a mosh song, but I am convinced that has a deeper meaning, even though these types of songs usually don't. grissomon July 29, 2007\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "tORxFdihYPFveodf", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107859465588", "lyrics": "Like a crack in the clean slate\n I see emotion take over the rational\n We are the favoured sons of reason\n With tools at our disposal\n Squandered day by day\n \n Strip the thoughts\n Heal the system\n Take the original back\n It is inside me\n It is inside me now\n If this is all I can remember\n Can I ever trust myself\n \n Like a flash or a fleeting glance\n I see movement in the corner of my eye\n Now the mind goes into overdrive\n To process and deceive\n How will I ever know\n \n Give up the experience\n To halt the fictional mind\n It is inside me\n It is inside me now\n Block out all that makes it painful\n Set the pieces back in place\n \n I track movement\n Like light behind my eyes\n Made to match up\n With what I tell myself each day\n My experience\n Is what I do not know\n And one I cannot trust\n \n It infects the marrow\n A virus of ideas\n It is inside me\n It is inside me now\n What my mind is telling me\n Must come undone", "comment": "I think this song is more about general situations in which you can't trust yourself, especially when your subconsciousness starts to do things beyond your control. For example if you fall in love with a person, everybody tells you to stay away from her/him, but of course you know it better than everyone else. When \"emotion takes over the rational\" you are not able to focus on clear thoughts. You're wondering, if it's really like you see it, or just because love is blind. You just can't be sure anymore if what your mind tells you is actually true or not. Your \"mind goes into overdrive, to process and deceive\" you and you start to lose faith in yourself. To get all over this, you have to \"halt the fictional mind\", \"block out all that makes it painful\" and finally \"set the pieces back in place\".

I think this song should just be something that the listener should use as a way to figure out what they believe about abortion. People should use things like this and personal expirences to decide whether they agree or disagree with something. Just saying something is wrong because some old white guy with a (horribly contradictory and pointless) book says it's wrong doesn't mean you should think it is. I practically grew up around pregnant teenagers (my mom worked at a school for teen moms), so I think women should have the right to choose what they do with their own body, pun not intended. But that's just me. I also think this song is pretty hystarical if you look at it from a humorist's point of view.

The blind man is not just a person, or a country - it's mankind. Almost every nation has been in a conflict or war.

Check it on the concert from Sydney 1994 and you understand what I mean. jn1720on January 24, 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"music4all_id": "uv4Fps30I4no5g0s", "songmeanings_id": "3696", "lyrics": "This town don't feel mine\n I'm fast to get away\n Far\n \n I dressed you in her clothes\n So drive me far away, away, away\n \n It feels good to know you're mine\n Now drive me far away, away, away\n \n Far\n Away\n I don't care where, just far away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care\n Far\n \n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care\n Far\n \n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care\n Far\n \n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n I don't care where, just far\n Away\n Said, far\n Away\n I don't care where, far\n Away\n I don't care just where, far\n Away", "comment": "you cant honestly think this song is about driving or going on a road trip or whatever stupidness. it makes me quite sad to think such ignorant people listen to such great music. the song is obviously about some kind of greivance with a female character whos left his life and hes tried to replace her. i also liked the interpretation of it being a kidnapper talking about his crime. but no, its not about \"getting in your car and turning the AC\" on you fuckin idiots. clyro57on July 19, 2008\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link1 Reply "}, {"music4all_id": "v2ovOTn15Y6HErP7", "songmeanings_id": "3530822107858646557", "lyrics": "Breathing from a hole in my lung\n I had no one\n But faces in front of me\n Racing through the void in my head\n To find traces\n Of a good luck academy\n Ooh, Ooh, Ooh\n \n Sparks ignite and trade them for thought\n About no one\n And nothing in particular\n Washed the sickened socket and drove\n Resent nothing\n There's good will inside of me\n Ooh, Ooh, Ooh\n \n Wake me up lower the fever\n Walking in a straight line\n Set me on fire in the evening\n Everything will be fine\n Waking up strong in the morning\n Walking in a straight line\n Lately I'm a desperate believer\n But walking in a straight line\n \n Something I will never forget\n I felt desperate\n And stuck to the marrow\n Invisible to everyone else\n I'm a sex change\n And a damsel with no heroine\n Ooh, Ooh, Ooh\n \n Wake me up lower the fever\n Walking in a straight line\n Set me on fire in the evening\n Everything will be fine\n Waking up strong in the morning\n Walking in a straight line\n Lately I'm a desperate believer\n But walking in a straight line\n \n I don't need no time to say\n There's no changing yesterday\n If we keep talking and\n I keep walking in straight lines\n \n Wake me up lower the fever\n Walking in a straight line\n Set me on fire in the evening\n Everything will be fine\n Waking up strong in the morning\n Walking in a straight line\n Lately I'm a desperate believer\n But walking in a straight line", "comment": "I think this song is about overcoming his reactive arthritis not his anorexia which he was well over when he would have wrote this. 'searching to find traces of a good luck academy' might be Johns not being able to believe how unlucky he has been with illnesses. He talks about being set on fire in the evening, to me that's the pain in his joints. He got so weak he needed help to get around so didnt feel like a man anymore - sex change. (bit sexist but hey they are newy bogans at heart) As the song builds and gets stronger, so does he. He apparently even had to use a walking stick for a while, thats how bad it got, so although I think 'walking in a straight line' can be taken semi literally, to me it more represents just getting stronger, getting back on track and not looking back and just fuckin charging.
